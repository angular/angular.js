AngularJS
=========

AngularJS lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser.  It lets use
good old HTML (or HAML, Jade and friends!) as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s
syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly.  It automatically
synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data
binding. To help you structure your application better and make it easy to test AngularJS teaches
the browser how to do dependency injection and inversion of control. Oh yeah and it also helps with
server-side communication, taming async callbacks with promises and deferreds; and make client-side
navigation and deeplinking with hashbang urls or HTML5 pushState a piece of cake. The most important
of all: it makes development fun!
