# [Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/closure-compiler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/closure-compiler)

The [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) is a tool for making JavaScript download and run faster. It is a true compiler for JavaScript. Instead of compiling from a source language to machine code, it compiles from JavaScript to better JavaScript. It parses your JavaScript, analyzes it, removes dead code and rewrites and minimizes what's left. It also checks syntax, variable references, and types, and warns about common JavaScript pitfalls.

## Getting Started
 * [Download the latest version](http://dl.google.com/closure-compiler/compiler-latest.zip)
 * See the [Google Developers Site](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/gettingstarted_app) for documentation including instructions for running the compiler from the command line.

## Options for Getting Help
1. Post in the [Closure Compiler Discuss Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/closure-compiler-discuss)
2. Ask a question on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-closure-compiler)
3. Consult the [FAQ](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/FAQ)

## Building it Yourself

Note: The Closure Compiler requires [Java 7 or higher](http://www.java.com/).

### Using [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)

1. Download the [Ant build tool](http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi).

2. At the root of the source tree, there is an Ant file named ```build.xml```.
   To use it, navigate to the same directory and type the command

    ```
    ant jar
    ```

    This will produce a jar file called ```build/compiler.jar```.

### Using [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/)

1. Download and open the [Eclipse IDE](http://www.eclipse.org/).
2. Navigate to ```File > New > Project ...``` and create a Java Project. Give
   the project a name.
3. Select ```Create project from existing source``` and choose the root of the
   checked-out source tree as the existing directory.
3. Navigate to the ```build.xml``` file. You will see all the build rules in
   the Outline pane. Run the ```jar``` rule to build the compiler in
   ```build/compiler.jar```.

## Running

On the command line, at the root of this project, type

```
java -jar build/compiler.jar
```

This starts the compiler in interactive mode. Type

```javascript
var x = 17 + 25;
```

then hit "Enter", then hit "Ctrl-Z" (on Windows) or "Ctrl-D" (on Mac or Linux)
and "Enter" again. The Compiler will respond:

```javascript
var x=42;
```

The Closure Compiler has many options for reading input from a file, writing
output to a file, checking your code, and running optimizations. To learn more,
type

```
java -jar compiler.jar --help
```

More detailed information about running the Closure Compiler is available in the
[documentation](http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/gettingstarted_app.html).

## Compiling Multiple Scripts

If you have multiple scripts, you should compile them all together with one
compile command.

```bash
java -jar compiler.jar --js_output_file=out.js in1.js in2.js in3.js ...
```

You can also use minimatch-style globs.

```bash
# Recursively include all js files in subdirs
java -jar compiler.jar --js_output_file=out.js 'src/**.js'

# Recursively include all js files in subdirs, exclusing test files.
# Use single-quotes, so that bash doesn't try to expand the '!'
java -jar compiler.jar --js_output_file=out.js 'src/**.js' '!**_test.js'
```

The Closure Compiler will concatenate the files in the order they're passed at
the command line.

If you're using globs or many files, you may start to run into
problems with managing dependencies between scripts. In this case, you should
use the [Closure Library](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/). It
contains functions for enforcing dependencies between scripts, and Closure Compiler
will re-order the inputs automatically.

## How to Contribute
### Reporting a bug
1. First make sure that it is really a bug and not simply the way that Closure Compiler works (especially true for ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS).
 * Check the [official documentation](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/)
 * Consult the [FAQ](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/FAQ)
 * Search on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-closure-compiler) and in the [Closure Compiler Discuss Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/closure-compiler-discuss)
2. If you still think you have found a bug, make sure someone hasn't already reported it. See the list of [known issues](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues).
3. If it hasn't been reported yet, post a new issue. Make sure to add enough detail so that the bug can be recreated. The smaller the reproduction code, the better.

### Suggesting a Feature
1. Consult the [FAQ](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/FAQ) to make sure that the behaviour you would like isn't specifically excluded (such as string inlining).
2. Make sure someone hasn't requested the same thing. See the list of [known issues](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues).
3. Read up on [what type of feature requests are accepted](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-submit-a-feature-request-for-a-new-type-of-optimization).
4. Submit your reqest as an issue.

### Submitting patches
1. All contributors must sign a contributor license agreement. See the [CONTRIBUTORS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/closure-compiler/master/CONTRIBUTORS) file for details.
2. To make sure your changes are of the type that will be accepted, ask about your patch on the [Closure Compiler Discuss Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/closure-compiler-discuss)
3. Fork the repository.
4. Make your changes.
5. Submit a pull request for your changes. A project developer will review your work and then merge your request into the project.
