<h2>Description</h2>
<div class="description">
  <p>This error occurs when the HTML string passed to &#39;$sanitize&#39; can&#39;t be parsed by the sanitizer.
The error contains part of the html string that can&#39;t be parsed.</p>
<p>The parser is more strict than a typical browser parser, so it&#39;s possible that some obscure input would produce this error despite the string being recognized as valid HTML by a browser.</p>
<p>If a valid html code results in this error, please file a bug.</p>
