</div>

<h2>Description</h2>
<div class="description">
  <p>Copying Window or Scope instances is not supported because of cyclical and self
references. Avoid copying windows and scopes, as well as any other cyclical or
self-referential structures. Note that trying to deep copy an object containing
cyclical references that is neither a window nor a scope will cause infinite
recursion and a stack overflow.</p>
