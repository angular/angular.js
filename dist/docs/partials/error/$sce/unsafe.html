<h2>Description</h2>
<div class="description">
  <p>The value provided for use in a specific context was not found to be safe/trusted for use.</p>
<p>Angular&#39;s <a href="api/ng/service/$sce">Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE)</a> mode
(enabled by default), requires bindings in certain
contexts to result in a value that is trusted as safe for use in such a context.  (e.g. loading an
Angular template from a URL requires that the URL is one considered safe for loading resources.)</p>
<p>This helps prevent XSS and other security issues.  Read more at
<a href="api/ng/service/$sce">Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE)</a></p>
<p>You may want to include the ngSanitize module to use the automatic sanitizing.</p>
