        <td><p>The <code>$animate</code> service provides animation detection support while performing DOM operations (enter, leave and move) as well as during addClass and removeClass operations.
When any of these operations are run, the $animate service
will examine any JavaScript-defined animations (which are defined by using the $animateProvider provider object)
as well as any CSS-defined animations against the CSS classes present on the element once the DOM operation is run.</p>
