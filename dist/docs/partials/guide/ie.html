<h1 id="internet-explorer-compatibility">Internet Explorer Compatibility</h1>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong>Note:</strong> AngularJS 1.3 has dropped support for IE8. Read more about it on
<a href="http://blog.angularjs.org/2013/12/angularjs-13-new-release-approaches.html">our blog</a>.
AngularJS 1.2 will continue to support IE8, but the core team does not plan to spend time
addressing issues specific to IE8 or earlier.

<p>This document describes the Internet Explorer (IE) idiosyncrasies when dealing with custom HTML
attributes and tags. Read this document if you are planning on deploying your Angular application
on IE.</p>
<p>The project currently supports and will attempt to fix bugs for IE9 and above. The continuous
integration server runs all the tests against IE9, IE10, and IE11. See
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/angular/angular.js">Travis CI</a> and
<a href="http://ci.angularjs.org">ci.angularjs.org</a>.</p>
<p>We do not run tests on IE8 and below. A subset of the AngularJS functionality may work on these
browsers, but it is up to you to test and decide whether it works for your particular app.</p>
<p>To ensure your Angular application works on IE please consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <code>ng-style</code> tags instead of <code>style=&quot;{{ someCss }}&quot;</code>. The latter works in Chrome and Firefox
but does not work in Internet Explorer &lt;= 11 (the most recent version at time of writing).</li>
</ol>
