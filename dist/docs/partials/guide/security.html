<h1 id="security">Security</h1>
<p>This document explains some of AngularJS&#39;s security features and best practices that you should
keep in mind as you build your application.</p>
<h2 id="expression-sandboxing">Expression Sandboxing</h2>
<p>AngularJS&#39;s expressions are sandboxed not for security reasons, but instead to maintain a proper
separation of application responsibilities. For example, access to <code>window</code> is disallowed
because it makes it easy to introduce brittle global state into your application.</p>
<p>However, this sandbox is not intended to stop attackers who can edit the template before it&#39;s
processed by Angular. It may be possible to run arbitrary JavaScript inside double-curly bindings
if an attacker can modify them.</p>
<p>But if an attacker can change arbitrary HTML templates, there&#39;s nothing stopping them from doing:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;script&gt;somethingEvil();&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It&#39;s better to design your application in such a way that users cannot change client-side templates.
For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not mix client and server templates</li>
<li>Do not use user input to generate templates dynamically</li>
<li>Do not run user input through <code>$scope.$eval</code></li>
<li>Consider using <a href="api/ng/directive/ngCsp">CSP</a> (but don&#39;t rely only on CSP)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mixing-client-side-and-server-side-templates">Mixing client-side and server-side templates</h2>
<p>In general, we recommend against this because it can create unintended XSS vectors.</p>
<p>However, it&#39;s ok to mix server-side templating in the bootstrap template (<code>index.html</code>) as long
as user input cannot be used on the server to output html that would then be processed by Angular
in a way that would cause allow for arbitrary code execution.</p>
<p>For instance, you can use server-side templating to dynamically generate CSS, URLs, etc, but not
for generating templates that are bootstrapped/compiled by Angular.</p>
