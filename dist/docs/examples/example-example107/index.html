  <p><strong>{{username}}</strong> attempts to inject code which will deface the
    application, but fails to accomplish their task, because the server has correctly
    escaped the interpolation start/end markers with REVERSE SOLIDUS U+005C (backslash)
    characters.</p>
  <p>Instead, the result of the attempted script injection is visible, and can be removed
    from the database by an administrator.</p>
