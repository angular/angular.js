# <angular/> 0.9.7 sonic-cream (in-progress) #

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed failed assignments of form obj[0].name=value (issue #169)

### Breaking changes
- Angular expressions in the view used to support regular expressions. This feature was rarely 
  used and added unnecessary complexity. It not a good idea to have regexps in the view anyway, 
  so we removed this support. If you had any regexp in your views, you will have to move them to 
  your controllers.

# <angular/> 0.9.6 night-vision (2010-12-06) #

### Security
- several improvements in the HTML sanitizer code to prevent code execution via `href`s and other
  attributes.

  - 2bbced212e2ee93948c45360fee00b2e3f960392

### Docs
- set up http://docs.angularjs.org domain, the docs for the latest release will from now on be
  deployed here.
- docs app UI polishing with dual scrolling and other improvements

### Bug Fixes
- `select` widget now behaves correctly when it's `option` items are created via `ng:repeat` 
  (issue #170)
- fix for async xhr cache issue #152 by adding `$browser.defer` and `$defer` service

### Breaking Changes
- Fix for issue #152 might break some tests that were relying on the incorrect behavior. The
  breakage will usually affect code that tests resources, xhr or services/widgets build on top of
  these. All that is typically needed to resolve the issue is adding a call to
  `$browser.defer.flush()` in your test just before the point where you expect all cached
  resource/xhr requests to return any results. Please see 011fa39c2a0b5da843395b538fc4e52e5ade8287
  for more info.
- The HTML sanitizer is slightly more strinct now. Please see info in the "Security" section above.


# <angular/> 0.9.5 turkey-blast (2010-11-25) #

### Docs
- 99% of the content from the angular wiki is now in the docs

### Api
- added `angular.Array.limitTo` to make it easy to select first or last few items of an array


# <angular/> 0.9.4 total-recall (2010-11-18) #

### Docs
- searchable docs
- UI improvements
- we now have ~85% of the wiki docs migrated to ng docs
- some but not all docs were updated along the way


### Api
- ng:include now supports `onload` attribute (commit cc749760)

### Misc
- Better error handling - compilation exception now contain stack trace (commit b2d63ac4)


# <angular/> 0.9.3 cold-resistance (2010-11-10) #

### Docs
- prettier docs app with syntax highlighting for examples, etc
- added documentation, examples and scenario tests for many more apis including:
  - all directives
  - all formatters
  - all validators
  - some widgets

### Api
- date filter now accepts strings that angular.String.toDate can convert to Date objects
- angular.String.toDate supports ISO8061 formated strings with all time fractions being optional
- ng:repeat now exposes $position with values set to 'first', 'middle' or 'last'
- ng:switch now supports ng:switch-default as fallback switch option

### Breaking changes
- we now support ISO 8601 extended format datetime strings (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ) as defined
  in EcmaScript 5 throughout angular. This means that the following apis switched from
  YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ to YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ (note the added millis) when representing dates:
  - angular.Date.toString
  - angular.String.fromDate
  - JSON serialization and deserialization (used by json filter, $xhr and $resource)
- removed SSN validator. It's unlikely that most people will need it and if they do, it can be added
  simple RegExp validator.


# <angular/> 0.9.2 faunal-mimicry (2010-11-03) #

### Docs
- created documentation framework based on jsdoc syntax (commit 659af29a)
  - jsdoc parser
  - template generator
  - json generator
  - angular doc viewer app
  - scenario runner for all example code
- documentation for all angular filters (commits 1fe7e3a1 & 1ba8c2a33)
  - docs
  - example code
  - scenario tests for example code

### Testability
#### Scenario Runner
- binding DSL in Scenario can now match bindings without specifying filters
- dsl statements now accept a label argument to make test output more readable (issue #94)
- dsl element() statement now implements most of the jQuery API (issue #106)
- new browser() dsl statement for getting info about the emulated browser running the app
  (issue #109)
- scenario runner is now compatible with IE8 (issue #93)
- scenarior runner checks if URL would return a non-success status code (issue #100)
- binding() DSL now accepts regular expressions
- new textarea() scenario runner DSL for entering text into textareas

### Misc
- lots of small bugfixes

### Breaking changes
#### Scenario Runner
- navigating to about:blank is no longer supported. It results in a sandbox error
- navigateTo() is now browser().navigateTo(). Old code must be updated
- file:// URLs are no longer supported for running a scenario. You must use a web server that
  implements HEAD


# <angular/> 0.9.1 repulsion-field (2010-10-26) #

### Security

### Chores

  $inject as any other non-global service
- html filter now sanitizes html content for XSS attacks which may result in different behavior


# <angular/> 0.9.0 dragon-breath (2010-10-20) #

### Security
- angular.fromJson not safer (issue #57)
- readString consumes invalid escapes (issue #56)

### Speed
- css cleanup + inline all css and images in the main js (issue #64)

### Testability
- initial version of the built-in end-to-end scenario runner (issues #50, #67, #70)

### API
- allow ng:controller nesting (issue #39)
- new built-in date format filter (issue #45)

### Chores
- release versioning + file renaming (issue #69)

### Breaking changes
- $location.parse was replaced with $location.update
- all css and img files were inlined into the main js file, to support IE7 and older app must host
  angular-ie-compat.js file
