  ([example](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/example/personalLog/scenario/runner.html#L5))



<a name="0.9.15"><a/>
# <angular/> 0.9.15 lethal-stutter (2011-04-11) #

### Features
- IE9 support


### Bug Fixes
- reverted [ng:view] sync cache fix due to regression in the order of initialization of parent
  and child controllers. (commits 9bd2c396 and 3d388498)
- [$resource] success callback is now executed whenever the http status code is <200,300>


### Docs
- fixed intentation code that caused some of the snippets on docs.angularjs.org to be mangled.
- many small improvements of the api docs.



<a name="0.9.14"><a/>
# <angular/> 0.9.14 key-maker (2011-04-01) #

### Performance
- [ng:repeat] grows (adds children) significantly faster. (commit 15ec78f5)
- [$xhr.cache] optionally executes callbacks synchronously. (commit c06c5a36)
- [ng:view] and [ng:include] use sync [$xhr.cache]


### Bug Fixes
- Fixed [$resource] encoding of query params. (commits e1d122a4, 78a0f410)


### House cleaning
- code cleanup
- better minification (min is now 2.5% or almost 1kb smaller)
- minor documentation fixes
- JsTestDriver 1.3.2 upgrade with fixed coverage support



<a name="0.9.13"><a/>
# <angular/> 0.9.13 curdling-stare (2011-03-13) #

### New Features
- Added XSRF protection for the [$xhr] service. (commit c578f8c3)
- Targeted auto-bootstrap â€” [ng:autobind] now takes an optional value which specifies an element id
  to be compiled instead of compiling the entire html document. (commit 9d5c5337)


### Bug Fixes
- Fixed IE7 regression which prevented angular from bootstrapping in this browser.
- Cookies which contain unescaped '=' are now visible via the [$cookies] service. (commit 26bad2bf)
- [$xhr] service now executes "success" callback for all 2xx responses, not just 200.
  (commit 5343deb3)
- Always remove the script tag after successful JSONP request. (commit 0084cb5c)
- Removal of all `document.write` statements to make angular compabile with async script loaders.
  (commit 3224862a)


### Breaking changes
- The `post` parameter of [$browser.xhr][$browser] is now non-optional. Since everyone should be
  using the [$xhr] service instead of $browser.xhr, this should not break anyone. If you do use
  $browser.xhr then just add null for the post value argument where post was not passed in.




<a name="0.9.12"><a/>
# <angular/> 0.9.12 thought-implanter (2011-03-03) #

### API
- Added a delay parameter to the [$defer] service. (commit edbe9d8c)
- Added `scope()` method to [angular.element][element] (jQuery) instances to retrieve a [scope]
  associated with a given DOM element. (commit 0a5c00ab)
- Added inference of DI dependencies from function signature. This feature is experimental, check
  out [dependency injection][guide.di] docs. (commit 7d4aee31)


### New Features
- Angular now correctly recognizes and uses jQuery even if it was loaded after angular's script.
  More info at [angular.element][element]. (commit a004d487)
- All built-in angular services are now lazy-loaded. (commit a070ff5a)
- To make styling of custom html tags created via [widgets][widget] and [directives][directive]
  easier, all of these elements now contain a css class with name in form of
  `<namespace>-<directive/widget name>`, e.g. `<ng:include class="ng-include">`. (commit c7998f5f)
- [$xhr] service now automatically detects and strips google-style JSON security prefix from http
  responses. (commit cd139f57)


### Bug Fixes
- Rewrite of JQuery lite implementation for better supports operations on multiple nodes when
  matched by a selector and remove other bugs. (commit 00cc9eb3)
- Corrected an issue where properties inherited from \_\_proto\_\_ show up in ng:repeat.
  (commit 9e67da42)
- Fixed url encoding issue affecting [$resource] service. (commits e9ce2259 + 9e30baad)
- Removed `$eval()` call from the [$cookies] factory function, which was causing duplicate
  instances of singleton services to be created. (commit 65585a2d)


### Docs
- New docs [contribution guidelines][contribute].
- New [description of release artifacts][downloading].
- Lots of improvements and other new content.


### Breaking changes
- Removed the `$init()` method that used to be called after compilation of a template. This should
  affect only fraction of angular apps because the api was primarily being used by low level widgets
  tests.

  The old way of compiling the DOM element was angular.compile(element).$init(); The $init was there
  to allow the users to do any work to the scope before the view would be bound. This is a left over
  from not having proper MVC. The new recommended way to deal with initializing scope is to put it
  in the root constructor controller. To migrate simply remove the call to $init() and move any code
  you had before $init() to the root controller.

  (commit 23b255a8)
- Changed [angular.compile][compile] API from `angular.compile(element[, scope])` to
  `angular.compile(element)([scope], [cloneAttachFn])` (commits ef4bb28b + 945056b1)
- Removed ng:watch directives since it encourages logic in the UI. (commit 87cbf9f5)




<a name="0.9.11"><a/>
# <angular/> 0.9.11 snow-maker  (2011-02-08) #

### Documentation
- completed migration of docs from the wiki site to
  [http://docs.angularjs.org/](http://docs.angularjs.org/)
- many, but by far not all, docs were updated, improved and cleaned up

### Features
- [`$route`](http://docs.angularjs.org/#!/api/angular.service.$route) service now supports these
  features:
  - route not found handling via `#otherwise()`
  - redirection support via `#when('/foo', {redirectTo: '/bar'})` (including param interpolation)
  - setting the parent scope for scopes created by the service via `#parent()`
  - reloading the current route via `#reload()`

### API
- added `angular.element(...).scope()` method to retrieve scope for a given element.

### Bug Fixes
- <option> value attribute gets clobbered when the element contains new line character(s).
- <ng:view> widget now works when nested inside an <ng:include> widget
- other various small fixes

### Breaking changes
- mock [`$browser`](http://docs.angularjs.org/#!/api/angular.mock.service.$browser) now throws an
  exception if the `flush()` method is called when there are no requests to be flushed. If you
  experience `No xhr requests to be flushed!` errors in your tests, it's because you called
  `$browser.xhr.flush()` unexpectedly. To make the error go away, either make sure your code makes a
  request via the `$xhr` service or remove all unneeded `flush()` calls.


<a name="0.9.10"><a/>
# <angular/> 0.9.10 flea-whisperer  (2011-01-26) #

### Features
- new [`ng:view`](http://docs.angularjs.org/#!/api/angular.widget.ng:view) widget to simplify integration
with the `$route` service
- the content of all standard HTML widgets is now being processed
  (e.g. `<button>{{foo}}</button>` works now) (commit 1d7b9d56)
- new [`$log`](http://docs.angularjs.org/#!/api/angular.mock.service.$log) and
  [`$exceptionHandler`](http://docs.angularjs.org/#!/api/angular.mock.service.$exceptionHandler) service
  mocks now part of `angular-mocks.js` (commit f5d08963)

### Bug Fixes
- <select> (one/multiple) could not chose from a list of objects (commit 347be5ae)
- null and other falsy values should not be rendered in the view (issue #242)

### Docs
- rewrite of several major portions of angular.service.*, angular.Array.*, angular.Object.* docs
- added support for [sitemap]((http://docs.angularjs.org/sitemap.xml) to make the docs indexable by
  search crawlers
- transition of Developer Guide docs from the wiki into docs.angularjs.org
- lots of improvements related to formatting of the content of docs.anguarjs.org


<a name="0.9.9"><a/>
# <angular/> 0.9.9 time-shift (2011-01-13) #

### Security
- Added a just in case security check for JSON parsing. (commit 5f080193)
- Completed security review with the Google Security Team.

### Performance
- $location and $cookies services are now lazily initialized to avoid the polling overhead when
  not needed.
- $location service now listens for `onhashchange` events (if supported by browser) instead of
  constant polling. (commit 16086aa3)
- input widgets known listens on keydown events instead of keyup which improves perceived
  performance (commit 47c454a3)
- angular boots significantly sooner by listening for DOMContentLoaded event instead of
  window.load when supported by browser (commit c79aba92)
- new service $updateView which may be used in favor of $root.$eval() to run a complete eval on
  the entire document. This service bulks and throttles DOM updates to improve performance.
  (commit 47c454a3)

### Docs
- Major improvements to the doc parser (commit 4f22d686)
- Docs now offline enabled (all dependencies are bundled in the tarball) (commit 4f5d5029)
- Added support for navigating the docs app with keyboard shortcuts (tab and ctrl+alt+s)

### Bugfixes
- `angular.Object.equals` now properly handless comparing an object with a null (commit b0be87f6)
- Several issues were addressed in the `$location` service (commit 23875cb3)
- angular.filter.date now properly handles some corner-cases (issue #159 - fix contributed by Vojta)

### Breaking changes
- API for accessing registered services â€” `scope.$inject` â€” was renamed to
  [`scope.$service`](http://docs.angularjs.org/#!/api/angular.scope.$service). (commit b2631f61)

- Support for `eager-published` services was removed. This change was done to make explicit
  dependency declaration always required in order to allow making relatively expensive services
  lazily initialized (e.g. $cookie, $location), as well as remove 'magic' and reduce unnecessary
  scope namespace pollution. (commit 3ea5941f)

  Complete list of affected services:

  - $location
  - $route
  - $cookies
  - $window
  - $document
  - $exceptionHandler
  - $invalidWidgets

  To temporarily preserve the 'eager-published' status for these services, you may use `ng:init`
  (e.g. `ng:init="$location = $service('$location'), ...`) in the view or more correctly create
  a service like this:

      angular.service('published-svc-shim', function($location, $route, $cookies, $window,
          $document, $exceptionHandler, $invalidWidgets) {
        this.$location = $location;
        this.$route = $route;
        this.$cookies = $cookies;
        this.$window = $window;
        this.$document = $document;
        this.$exceptionHandler = $exceptionHandler;
        this.$invalidWidgets = $invalidWidgets;
      }, {$inject: ['$location', '$route', '$cookies', '$window', '$document', '$exceptionHandler',
                    '$invalidWidgets'],
          $eager: true});

- In the light of the `eager-published` change, to complete the cleanup we renamed `$creation`
  property of services to `$eager` with its value being a boolean.
  To transition, please rename all `$creation: 'eager'` declarations to `$eager: true`.
  (commit 1430c6d6)

- `angular.foreach` was renamed to `angular.forEach` to make the api consistent. (commit 0a6cf70d)

- The `toString` method of the `angular.service.$location` service was removed. (commit 23875cb3)

### Docs/Getting started
- angular-seed project to get you hacking on an angular apps quickly
  https://github.com/angular/angular-seed

### Performance
- Delegate JSON parsing to native parser (JSON.parse) if available

### Bug Fixes
- Ignore input widgets which have no name (issue #153)


<a name="0.9.7"><a/>
# <angular/> 0.9.7 sonic-scream (2010-12-10) #

### Bug Fixes
- $defer service should always call $eval on the root scope after a callback runs (issue #189)
- fix for failed assignments of form obj[0].name=value (issue #169)
- significant parser improvements that resulted in lower memory usage
  (commit 23fc73081feb640164615930b36ef185c23a3526)

### Docs
- small docs improvements (mainly docs for the $resource service)

### Breaking changes
- Angular expressions in the view used to support regular expressions. This feature was rarely
  used and added unnecessary complexity. It not a good idea to have regexps in the view anyway,
  so we removed this support. If you had any regexp in your views, you will have to move them to
  your controllers. (commit e5e69d9b90850eb653883f52c76e28dd870ee067)


<a name="0.9.6"><a/>
# <angular/> 0.9.6 night-vision (2010-12-06) #

### Security
- several improvements in the HTML sanitizer code to prevent code execution via `href`s and other
  attributes.
  Commits:
  - 41d5938883a3d06ffe8a88a51efd8d1896f7d747
  - 2bbced212e2ee93948c45360fee00b2e3f960392

### Docs
- set up http://docs.angularjs.org domain, the docs for the latest release will from now on be
  deployed here.
- docs app UI polishing with dual scrolling and other improvements

### Bug Fixes
- `select` widget now behaves correctly when it's `option` items are created via `ng:repeat`
  (issue #170)
- fix for async xhr cache issue #152 by adding `$browser.defer` and `$defer` service

### Breaking Changes
- Fix for issue #152 might break some tests that were relying on the incorrect behavior. The
  breakage will usually affect code that tests resources, xhr or services/widgets build on top of
  these. All that is typically needed to resolve the issue is adding a call to
  `$browser.defer.flush()` in your test just before the point where you expect all cached
  resource/xhr requests to return any results. Please see 011fa39c2a0b5da843395b538fc4e52e5ade8287
  for more info.
- The HTML sanitizer is slightly more strinct now. Please see info in the "Security" section above.

# <angular/> 0.9.5 turkey-blast (2010-11-25) #

### Docs
- 99% of the content from the angular wiki is now in the docs

### Api
- added `angular.Array.limitTo` to make it easy to select first or last few items of an array

# <angular/> 0.9.4 total-recall (2010-11-18) #

### Docs
- searchable docs
- UI improvements
- we now have ~85% of the wiki docs migrated to ng docs
- some but not all docs were updated along the way


### Api
- ng:include now supports `onload` attribute (commit cc749760)

### Misc
- Better error handling - compilation exception now contain stack trace (commit b2d63ac4)


<a name="0.9.3"><a/>
# <angular/> 0.9.3 cold-resistance (2010-11-10) #

### Docs
- prettier docs app with syntax highlighting for examples, etc
- added documentation, examples and scenario tests for many more apis including:
  - all directives
  - all formatters
  - all validators
  - some widgets

### Api
- date filter now accepts strings that angular.String.toDate can convert to Date objects
- angular.String.toDate supports ISO8061 formated strings with all time fractions being optional
- ng:repeat now exposes $position with values set to 'first', 'middle' or 'last'
- ng:switch now supports ng:switch-default as fallback switch option

### Breaking changes
- we now support ISO 8601 extended format datetime strings (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ) as defined
  in EcmaScript 5 throughout angular. This means that the following apis switched from
  YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ to YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ (note the added millis) when representing dates:
  - angular.Date.toString
  - angular.String.fromDate
  - JSON serialization and deserialization (used by json filter, $xhr and $resource)
- removed SSN validator. It's unlikely that most people will need it and if they do, it can be added
  simple RegExp validator.


<a name="0.9.2"><a/>

### Testability
#### Scenario Runner
- binding DSL in Scenario can now match bindings without specifying filters
- dsl statements now accept a label argument to make test output more readable (issue #94)
- dsl element() statement now implements most of the jQuery API (issue #106)
- new browser() dsl statement for getting info about the emulated browser running the app
  (issue #109)
- scenario runner is now compatible with IE8 (issue #93)
- scenarior runner checks if URL would return a non-success status code (issue #100)
- binding() DSL now accepts regular expressions
- new textarea() scenario runner DSL for entering text into textareas

### Misc
- lots of small bugfixes

### Breaking changes
#### Scenario Runner
- navigating to about:blank is no longer supported. It results in a sandbox error
- navigateTo() is now browser().navigateTo(). Old code must be updated
- file:// URLs are no longer supported for running a scenario. You must use a web server that
  implements HEAD

### API
- allow ng:controller nesting (issue #39)
- new built-in date format filter (issue #45)
- $location needs method you call on updates (issue #32)


### Chores
- release versioning + file renaming (issue #69)

### Breaking changes
- $location.parse was replaced with $location.update
- all css and img files were inlined into the main js file, to support IE7 and older app must host
  angular-ie-compat.js file
