Firebase for code.angularjs.org
===============================

This folder contains the Google Firebase scripts for the code.angularjs.org setup.

firebase.json contains the rewrite rules that route every subdirectory request to the cloud function
in functions/index.js that serves the docs from the Firebase Google Cloud Storage bucket.

functions/index.js also contains a rule that deletes outdated build zip files
from the snapshot and snapshot-stable folders when new zip files are uploaded.

The deployment to the Google Cloud Storage bucket happens automatically via Travis. See the travis.yml
file in the repository root.

See /readme.firebase.docs.md for the firebase deployment to docs.angularjs.org
