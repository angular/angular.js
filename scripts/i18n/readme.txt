  Currently we get datetimesymbols.js, numberformatsymbols.js and currencySymbols.js from Closure library. The URLs are:
http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/closure/goog/i18n/numberformatsymbols.js
http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/closure/goog/i18n/datetimesymbols.js
http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/closure/goog/i18n/currency.js

  It should be updated from Closure library very rarely (once a year probably). These files are maintained by Shanjian Li (ldap is shanjian).
