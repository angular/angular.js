## Submitting issues

If you have questions about how to use AngularJS, please direct these to the
[Google Group][groups] discussion list or [StackOverflow][stackoverflow]. We are
also available on [IRC][irc].

### Guidelines

* Search the archive first, it's likely that your question was already answered.
* A live example demonstrating your problem or question, will get an answer faster.
* Create one using this [template][template]
* If you get help, help others. Good karma rulez!

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.
