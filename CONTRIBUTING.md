## Submitting issues

If you have questions about how to use AngularJS, please direct these to the
[Google Group][groups] discussion list or [StackOverflow][stackoverflow]. We are
also available on [IRC][irc].

## Guidelines

* Search the archive first, it's likely that your question was already answered.
* A live example demonstrating your problem or question, will get an answer faster.
* Create one using this [template][template]
* If you get help, help others. Good karma rulez!

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.

## Contributing to Source Code

We'd love for you to contribute to our source code and to make AngularJS even
better than it is today!

Please read the [contribution guidelines][contribute] to learn about how to submit code
as well as other useful info like how to build and test AngularJS code.

### Note to Localization Pull Requests 

Angular.js currently uses the
[Google Closure I18N library], to generate its own I18N files. This means that any
changes to these files would be lost the next time that we import the library. The
recommended approach is to submit a patch to the I18N project directly, instead of
submitting it here.
