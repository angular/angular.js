 * # ngAnimate
 *
 * The `ngAnimate` module provides support for JavaScript, CSS3 transition and CSS3 keyframe animation hooks within existing core and custom directives.
 *
 * {@installModule animate}
 *
 * <div doc-module-components="ngAnimate"></div>
 *
 * # Usage
 *
 * To see animations in action, all that is required is to define the appropriate CSS classes
 * or to register a JavaScript animation via the myModule.animation() function. The directives that support animation automatically are:
 * `ngRepeat`, `ngInclude`, `ngIf`, `ngSwitch`, `ngShow`, `ngHide`, `ngView` and `ngClass`. Custom directives can take advantage of animation
 * by using the `$animate` service.
 *
 * Below is a more detailed breakdown of the supported animation events provided by pre-existing ng directives:
 *
 * | Directive                                                 | Supported Animations                               |
 * |---------------------------------------------------------- |----------------------------------------------------|
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat#usage_animations ngRepeat}         | enter, leave and move                              |
 * | {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView#usage_animations ngView}        | enter and leave                                    |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngInclude#usage_animations ngInclude}       | enter and leave                                    |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngSwitch#usage_animations ngSwitch}         | enter and leave                                    |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngIf#usage_animations ngIf}                 | enter and leave                                    |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngClass#usage_animations ngClass}           | add and remove                                     |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngShow#usage_animations ngShow & ngHide}    | add and remove (the ng-hide class value)           |
 *
 * You can find out more information about animations upon visiting each directive page.
 *
 * Below is an example of how to apply animations to a directive that supports animation hooks:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <style type="text/css">
 * .slide.ng-enter, .slide.ng-leave {
 *   -webkit-transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 * }
 *
 * .slide.ng-enter { }        /&#42; starting animations for enter &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-enter-active { } /&#42; terminal animations for enter &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-leave { }        /&#42; starting animations for leave &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-leave-active { } /&#42; terminal animations for leave &#42;/
 * </style>
 *
 * <!--
 * the animate service will automatically add .ng-enter and .ng-leave to the element
 * to trigger the CSS transition/animations
 * -->
 * <ANY class="slide" ng-include="..."></ANY>
 * </pre>
 *
 * Keep in mind that if an animation is running, any child elements cannot be animated until the parent element's
 * animation has completed.
 *
 * <h2>CSS-defined Animations</h2>
 * The animate service will automatically apply two CSS classes to the animated element and these two CSS classes
 * are designed to contain the start and end CSS styling. Both CSS transitions and keyframe animations are supported
 * and can be used to play along with this naming structure.
 *
 * The following code below demonstrates how to perform animations using **CSS transitions** with Angular:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <style type="text/css">
 * /&#42;
 *  The animate class is apart of the element and the ng-enter class
 *  is attached to the element once the enter animation event is triggered
 * &#42;/
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter {
 *  -webkit-transition: 1s linear all; /&#42; Safari/Chrome &#42;/
 *  transition: 1s linear all; /&#42; All other modern browsers and IE10+ &#42;/
 *
 *  /&#42; The animation preparation code &#42;/
 *  opacity: 0;
 * }
 *
 * /&#42;
 *  Keep in mind that you want to combine both CSS
 *  classes together to avoid any CSS-specificity
 *  conflicts
 * &#42;/
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *  /&#42; The animation code itself &#42;/
 *  opacity: 1;
 * }
 * </style>
 *
 * <div class="view-container">
 *   <div ng-view class="reveal-animation"></div>
 * </div>
 * </pre>
 *
 * The following code below demonstrates how to perform animations using **CSS animations** with Angular:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <style type="text/css">
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter {
 *   -webkit-animation: enter_sequence 1s linear; /&#42; Safari/Chrome &#42;/
 *   animation: enter_sequence 1s linear; /&#42; IE10+ and Future Browsers &#42;/
 * }
 * &#64-webkit-keyframes enter_sequence {
 *   from { opacity:0; }
 *   to { opacity:1; }
 * }
 * &#64keyframes enter_sequence {
 *   from { opacity:0; }
 *   to { opacity:1; }
 * }
 * </style>
 *
 * <div class="view-container">
 *   <div ng-view class="reveal-animation"></div>
 * </div>
 * </pre>
 *
 * Both CSS3 animations and transitions can be used together and the animate service will figure out the correct duration and delay timing.
 *
 * Upon DOM mutation, the event class is added first (something like `ng-enter`), then the browser prepares itself to add
 * the active class (in this case `ng-enter-active`) which then triggers the animation. The animation module will automatically
 * detect the CSS code to determine when the animation ends. Once the animation is over then both CSS classes will be
 * removed from the DOM. If a browser does not support CSS transitions or CSS animations then the animation will start and end
 * immediately resulting in a DOM element that is at its final state. This final state is when the DOM element
 * has no CSS transition/animation classes applied to it.
 *
 * <h3>CSS Staggering Animations</h3>
 * A Staggering animation is a collection of animations that are issued with a slight delay in between each successive operation resulting in a
 * curtain-like effect. The ngAnimate module, as of 1.2.0, supports staggering animations and the stagger effect can be
 * performed by creating a **ng-EVENT-stagger** CSS class and attaching that class to the base CSS class used for
 * the animation. The style property expected within the stagger class can either be a **transition-delay** or an
 * **animation-delay** property (or both if your animation contains both transitions and keyframe animations).
 *
 * <pre>
 * .my-animation.ng-enter {
 *   /&#42; standard transition code &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition: 1s linear all;
 *   transition: 1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter-stagger {
 *   /&#42; this will have a 100ms delay between each successive leave animation &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition-delay: 0.1s;
 *   transition-delay: 0.1s;
 *
 *   /&#42; in case the stagger doesn't work then these two values
 *    must be set to 0 to avoid an accidental CSS inheritance &#42;/
 *   -webkit-transition-duration: 0s;
 *   transition-duration: 0s;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   /&#42; standard transition styles &#42;/
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Staggering animations work by default in ngRepeat (so long as the CSS class is defiend). Outside of ngRepeat, to use staggering animations
 * on your own, they can be triggered by firing multiple calls to the same event on $animate. However, the restrictions surrounding this
 * are that each of the elements must have the same CSS className value as well as the same parent element. A stagger operation
 * will also be reset if more than 10ms has passed after the last animation has been fired.
 *
 * The following code will issue the **ng-leave-stagger** event on the element provided:
 *
 * <pre>
 * var kids = parent.children();
 *
 * $animate.leave(kids[0]); //stagger index=0
 * $animate.leave(kids[1]); //stagger index=1
 * $animate.leave(kids[2]); //stagger index=2
 * $animate.leave(kids[3]); //stagger index=3
 * $animate.leave(kids[4]); //stagger index=4
 *
 * $timeout(function() {
 *   //stagger has reset itself
 *   $animate.leave(kids[5]); //stagger index=0
 *   $animate.leave(kids[6]); //stagger index=1
 * }, 100, false);
 * </pre>
 *
 * Stagger animations are currently only supported within CSS-defined animations.
 *
 * <h2>JavaScript-defined Animations</h2>
 * In the event that you do not want to use CSS3 transitions or CSS3 animations or if you wish to offer animations on browsers that do not
 * yet support CSS transitions/animations, then you can make use of JavaScript animations defined inside of your AngularJS module.
 *
 * <pre>
 * //!annotate="YourApp" Your AngularJS Module|Replace this or ngModule with the module that you used to define your application.
 * var ngModule = angular.module('YourApp', []);
 * ngModule.animation('.my-crazy-animation', function() {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, done) {
 *       //run the animation here and call done when the animation is complete
 *       return function(cancelled) {
 *         //this (optional) function will be called when the animation
 *         //completes or when the animation is cancelled (the cancelled
 *         //flag will be set to true if cancelled).
 *       }
 *     }
 *     leave: function(element, done) { },
 *     move: function(element, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered before the class is added
 *     beforeAddClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered after the class is added
 *     addClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered before the class is removed
 *     beforeRemoveClass: function(element, className, done) { },
 *
 *     //animation that can be triggered after the class is removed
 *     removeClass: function(element, className, done) { }
 *   }
 * });
 * </pre>
 *
 * JavaScript-defined animations are created with a CSS-like class selector and a collection of events which are set to run
 * a javascript callback function. When an animation is triggered, $animate will look for a matching animation which fits
 * the element's CSS class attribute value and then run the matching animation event function (if found).
 * In other words, if the CSS classes present on the animated element match any of the JavaScript animations then the callback function
 * be executed. It should be also noted that only simple, single class selectors are allowed (compound class selectors are not supported).
 *
 * Within a JavaScript animation, an object containing various event callback animation functions is expected to be returned.
 * As explained above, these callbacks are triggered based on the animation event. Therefore if an enter animation is run,
 * and the JavaScript animation is found, then the enter callback will handle that animation (in addition to the CSS keyframe animation
 * or transition code that is defined via a stylesheet).
