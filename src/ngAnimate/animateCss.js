/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $animateCss
 * @kind object
 *
 * @description
 * The `$animateCss` service is a useful utility to trigger customized CSS-based transitions/keyframes
 * from a JavaScript-based animation or directly from a directive. The purpose of `$animateCss` is NOT
 * to side-step how `$animate` and ngAnimate work, but the goal is to allow pre-existing animations or
 * directives to create more complex animations that can be purely driven using CSS code.
 *
 * Note that only browsers that support CSS transitions and/or keyframe animations are capable of
 * rendering animations triggered via `$animateCss` (bad news for IE9 and lower).
 *
 * ## Usage
 * Once again, `$animateCss` is designed to be used inside of a registered JavaScript animation that
 * is powered by ngAnimate. It is possible to use `$animateCss` directly inside of a directive, however,
 * any automatic control over cancelling animations and/or preventing animations from being run on
 * child elements will not be handled by Angular. For this to work as expected, please use `$animate` to
 * trigger the animation and then setup a JavaScript animation that injects `$animateCss` to trigger
 * the CSS animation.
 *
 * The example below shows how we can create a folding animation on an element using `ng-if`:
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- notice the `fold-animation` CSS class -->
 * <div ng-if="onOff" class="fold-animation">
 *   This element will go BOOM
 * </div>
 * <button ng-click="onOff=true">Fold In</button>
 * ```
 *
 * Now we create the **JavaScript animation** that will trigger the CSS transition:
 *
 * ```js
 * ngModule.animation('.fold-animation', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       var height = element[0].offsetHeight;
 *       return $animateCss(element, {
 *         from: { height:'0px' },
 *         to: { height:height + 'px' },
 *         duration: 1 // one second
 *       });
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]);
 * ```
 *
 * ## More Advanced Uses
 *
 * `$animateCss` is the underlying code that ngAnimate uses to power **CSS-based animations** behind the scenes. Therefore CSS hooks
 * like `.ng-EVENT`, `.ng-EVENT-active`, `.ng-EVENT-stagger` are all features that can be triggered using `$animateCss` via JavaScript code.
 *
 * This also means that just about any combination of adding classes, removing classes, setting styles, dynamically setting a keyframe animation,
 * applying a hardcoded duration or delay value, changing the animation easing or applying a stagger animation are all options that work with
 * `$animateCss`. The service itself is smart enough to figure out the combination of options and examine the element styling properties in order
 * to provide a working animation that will run in CSS.
 *
 * The example below showcases a more advanced version of the `.fold-animation` from the example above:
 *
 * ```js
 * ngModule.animation('.fold-animation', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       var height = element[0].offsetHeight;
 *       return $animateCss(element, {
 *         addClass: 'red large-text pulse-twice',
 *         easing: 'ease-out',
 *         from: { height:'0px' },
 *         to: { height:height + 'px' },
 *         duration: 1 // one second
 *       });
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]);
 * ```
 *
 * Since we're adding/removing CSS classes then the CSS transition will also pick those up:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; since a hardcoded duration value of 1 was provided in the JavaScript animation code,
 * the CSS classes below will be transitioned despite them being defined as regular CSS classes &#42;/
 * .red { background:red; }
 * .large-text { font-size:20px; }
 *
 * /&#42; we can also use a keyframe animation and $animateCss will make it work alongside the transition &#42;/
 * .pulse-twice {
 *   animation: 0.5s pulse linear 2;
 *   -webkit-animation: 0.5s pulse linear 2;
 * }
 *
 * @keyframes pulse {
 *   from { transform: scale(0.5); }
 *   to { transform: scale(1.5); }
 * }
 *
 * @-webkit-keyframes pulse {
 *   from { -webkit-transform: scale(0.5); }
 *   to { -webkit-transform: scale(1.5); }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Given this complex combination of CSS classes, styles and options, `$animateCss` will figure everything out and make the animation happen.
 *
 * ## How the Options are handled
 *
 * `$animateCss` is very versatile and intelligent when it comes to figuring out what configurations to apply to the element to ensure the animation
 * works with the options provided. Say for example we were adding a class that contained a keyframe value and we wanted to also animate some inline
 * styles using the `from` and `to` properties.
 *
 * ```js
 * var animator = $animateCss(element, {
 *   from: { background:'red' },
 *   to: { background:'blue' }
 * });
 * animator.start();
 * ```
 *
 * ```css
 * .rotating-animation {
 *   animation:0.5s rotate linear;
 *   -webkit-animation:0.5s rotate linear;
 * }
 *
 * @keyframes rotate {
 *   from { transform: rotate(0deg); }
 *   to { transform: rotate(360deg); }
 * }
 *
 * @-webkit-keyframes rotate {
 *   from { -webkit-transform: rotate(0deg); }
 *   to { -webkit-transform: rotate(360deg); }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The missing pieces here are that we do not have a transition set (within the CSS code nor within the `$animateCss` options) and the duration of the animation is
 * going to be detected from what the keyframe styles on the CSS class are. In this event, `$animateCss` will automatically create an inline transition
 * style matching the duration detected from the keyframe style (which is present in the CSS class that is being added) and then prepare both the transition
 * and keyframe animations to run in parallel on the element. Then when the animation is underway the provided `from` and `to` CSS styles will be applied
 * and spread across the transition and keyframe animation.
 *
 * ## What is returned
 *
 * `$animateCss` works in two stages: a preparation phase and an animation phase. Therefore when `$animateCss` is first called it will NOT actually
 * start the animation. All that is going on here is that the element is being prepared for the animation (which means that the generated CSS classes are
 * added and removed on the element). Once `$animateCss` is called it will return an object with the following properties:
 *
 * ```js
 * var animator = $animateCss(element, { ... });
 * ```
 *
 * Now what do the contents of our `animator` variable look like:
 *
 * ```js
 * {
 *   // starts the animation
 *   start: Function,
 *
 *   // ends (aborts) the animation
 *   end: Function
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * To actually start the animation we need to run `animation.start()` which will then return a promise that we can hook into to detect when the animation ends.
 * If we choose not to run the animation then we MUST run `animation.end()` to perform a cleanup on the element (since some CSS classes and styles may have been
 * applied to the element during the preparation phase). Note that all other properties such as duration, delay, transitions and keyframes are just properties
 * and that changing them will not reconfigure the parameters of the animation.
 *
 * ### runner.done() vs runner.then()
 * It is documented that `animation.start()` will return a promise object and this is true, however, there is also an additional method available on the
 * runner called `.done(callbackFn)`. The done method works the same as `.finally(callbackFn)`, however, it does **not trigger a digest to occur**.
 * Therefore, for performance reasons, it's always best to use `runner.done(callback)` instead of `runner.then()`, `runner.catch()` or `runner.finally()`
 * unless you really need a digest to kick off afterwards.
 *
 * Keep in mind that, to make this easier, ngAnimate has tweaked the JS animations API to recognize when a runner instance is returned from $animateCss
 * (so there is no need to call `runner.done(doneFn)` inside of your JavaScript animation code).
 * Check the {@link ngAnimate.$animateCss#usage animation code above} to see how this works.
 *
 * @param {DOMElement} element the element that will be animated
 * @param {object} options the animation-related options that will be applied during the animation
 *
 * * `event` - The DOM event (e.g. enter, leave, move). When used, a generated CSS class of `ng-EVENT` and `ng-EVENT-active` will be applied
 * to the element during the animation. Multiple events can be provided when spaces are used as a separator. (Note that this will not perform any DOM operation.)
 * * `structural` - Indicates that the `ng-` prefix will be added to the event class. Setting to `false` or omitting will turn `ng-EVENT` and
 * `ng-EVENT-active` in `EVENT` and `EVENT-active`. Unused if `event` is omitted.
 * * `easing` - The CSS easing value that will be applied to the transition or keyframe animation (or both).
 * * `transitionStyle` - The raw CSS transition style that will be used (e.g. `1s linear all`).
 * * `keyframeStyle` - The raw CSS keyframe animation style that will be used (e.g. `1s my_animation linear`).
 * * `from` - The starting CSS styles (a key/value object) that will be applied at the start of the animation.
 * * `to` - The ending CSS styles (a key/value object) that will be applied across the animation via a CSS transition.
 * * `addClass` - A space separated list of CSS classes that will be added to the element and spread across the animation.
 * * `removeClass` - A space separated list of CSS classes that will be removed from the element and spread across the animation.
 * * `duration` - A number value representing the total duration of the transition and/or keyframe (note that a value of 1 is 1000ms). If a value of `0`
 * is provided then the animation will be skipped entirely.
 * * `delay` - A number value representing the total delay of the transition and/or keyframe (note that a value of 1 is 1000ms). If a value of `true` is
 * used then whatever delay value is detected from the CSS classes will be mirrored on the elements styles (e.g. by setting delay true then the style value
 * of the element will be `transition-delay: DETECTED_VALUE`). Using `true` is useful when you want the CSS classes and inline styles to all share the same
 * CSS delay value.
 * * `stagger` - A numeric time value representing the delay between successively animated elements
 * ({@link ngAnimate#css-staggering-animations Click here to learn how CSS-based staggering works in ngAnimate.})
 * * `staggerIndex` - The numeric index representing the stagger item (e.g. a value of 5 is equal to the sixth item in the stagger; therefore when a
 *   `stagger` option value of `0.1` is used then there will be a stagger delay of `600ms`)
 * * `applyClassesEarly` - Whether or not the classes being added or removed will be used when detecting the animation. This is set by `$animate` when enter/leave/move animations are fired to ensure that the CSS classes are resolved in time. (Note that this will prevent any transitions from occurring on the classes being added and removed.)
 * * `cleanupStyles` - Whether or not the provided `from` and `to` styles will be removed once
 *    the animation is closed. This is useful for when the styles are used purely for the sake of
 *    the animation and do not have a lasting visual effect on the element (e.g. a collapse and open animation).
 *    By default this value is set to `false`.
 *
 * @return {object} an object with start and end methods and details about the animation.
 *
 * * `start` - The method to start the animation. This will return a `Promise` when called.
 * * `end` - This method will cancel the animation and remove all applied CSS classes and styles.
