 * @ngdoc module
 * @name ngAnimate
 * @description
 *
 * The `ngAnimate` module provides support for CSS-based animations (keyframes and transitions) as well as JavaScript-based animations via
 * callback hooks. Animations are not enabled by default, however, by including `ngAnimate` then the animation hooks are enabled for an Angular app.
 *
 * <div doc-module-components="ngAnimate"></div>
 *
 * # Usage
 * Simply put, there are two ways to make use of animations when ngAnimate is used: by using **CSS** and **JavaScript**. The former works purely based
 * using CSS (by using matching CSS selectors/styles) and the latter triggers animations that are registered via `module.animation()`. For
 * both CSS and JS animations the sole requirement is to have a matching `CSS class` that exists both in the registered animation and within
 * the HTML element that the animation will be triggered on.
 *
 * ## Directive Support
 * The following directives are "animation aware":
 *
 * | Directive                                                                                                | Supported Animations                                                     |
 * |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat#animations ngRepeat}                                                        | enter, leave and move                                                    |
 * | {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView#animations ngView}                                                       | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngInclude#animations ngInclude}                                                      | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngSwitch#animations ngSwitch}                                                        | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngIf#animations ngIf}                                                                | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngClass#animations ngClass}                                                          | add and remove (the CSS class(es) present)                               |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngShow#animations ngShow} & {@link ng.directive:ngHide#animations ngHide}            | add and remove (the ng-hide class value)                                 |
 * | {@link ng.directive:form#animation-hooks form} & {@link ng.directive:ngModel#animation-hooks ngModel}    | add and remove (dirty, pristine, valid, invalid & all other validations) |
 * | {@link module:ngMessages#animations ngMessages}                                                          | add and remove (ng-active & ng-inactive)                                 |
 * | {@link module:ngMessages#animations ngMessage}                                                           | enter and leave                                                          |

 *
 * ## CSS-based Animations
 *
 * CSS-based animations with ngAnimate are unique since they require no JavaScript code at all. By using a CSS class that we reference between our HTML
 * and CSS code we can create an animation that will be picked up by Angular when an the underlying directive performs an operation.
 *
 * The example below shows how an `enter` animation can be made possible on a element using `ng-if`:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-if="bool" class="fade">
 *    Fade me in out
 * </div>
 * <button ng-click="bool=true">Fade In!</button>
 * <button ng-click="bool=false">Fade Out!</button>
 * ```
 *
 * Notice the CSS class **fade**? We can now create the CSS transition code that references this class:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; The starting CSS styles for the enter animation &#42;/
 * .fade.ng-enter {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 *
 * /&#42; The starting CSS styles for the enter animation &#42;/
 * .fade.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The key thing to remember here is that, depending on the animation event (which each of the directives above trigger depending on what's going on) two
 * generated CSS classes will be applied to the element; in the example above we have `.ng-enter` and `.ng-enter-active`. For CSS transitions, the transition
 * code **must** be defined within the starting CSS class (in this case `.ng-enter`). The destination class is what the transition will animate towards.
 *
 * If for example we wanted to create animations for `leave` and `move` (ngRepeat triggers move) then we can do so using the same CSS naming conventions:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; now the element will fade out before it is removed from the DOM &#42;/
 * .fade.ng-leave {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * .fade.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * We can also make use of **CSS Keyframes** by referencing the keyframe animation within the starting CSS class:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; there is no need to define anything inside of the destination
 * CSS class since the keyframe will take charge of the animation &#42;/
 * .fade.ng-leave {
 *   animation: my_fade_animation 0.5s linear;
 *   -webkit-animation: my_fade_animation 0.5s linear;
 * }
 *
 * @keyframes my_fade_animation {
 *   from { opacity:1; }
 *   to { opacity:0; }
 * }
 *
 * @-webkit-keyframes my_fade_animation {
 *   from { opacity:1; }
 *   to { opacity:0; }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Feel free also mix transitions and keyframes together as well as any other CSS classes on the same element.
 *
 * ### CSS Class-based Animations
 *
 * Class-based animations (animations that are triggered via `ngClass`, `ngShow`, `ngHide` and some other directives) have a slightly different
 * naming convention. Class-based animations are basic enough that a standard transition or keyframe can be referenced on the class being added
 * and removed.
 *
 * For example if we wanted to do a CSS animation for `ngHide` then we place an animation on the `.ng-hide` CSS class:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-show="bool" class="fade">
 *   Show and hide me
 * </div>
 * <button ng-click="bool=true">Toggle</button>
 *
 * <style>
 * .fade.ng-hide {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * </style>
 * ```
 *
 * All that is going on here with ngShow/ngHide behind the scenes is the `.ng-hide` class is added/removed (when the hidden state is valid). Since
 * ngShow and ngHide are animation aware then we can match up a transition and ngAnimate handles the rest.
 *
 * In addition the addition and removal of the CSS class, ngAnimate also provides two helper methods that we can use to further decorate the animation
 * with CSS styles.
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-class="{on:onOff}" class="highlight">
 *   Highlight this box
 * </div>
 * <button ng-click="onOff=!onOff">Toggle</button>
 *
 * <style>
 * .highlight {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 * }
 * .highlight.on-add {
 *   background:white;
 * }
 * .highlight.on {
 *   background:yellow;
 * }
 * .highlight.on-remove {
 *   background:black;
 * }
 * </style>
 * ```
 *
 * We can also make use of CSS keyframes by placing them within the CSS classes.
 *
 *
 * ### CSS Staggering Animations
 * A Staggering animation is a collection of animations that are issued with a slight delay in between each successive operation resulting in a
 * curtain-like effect. The ngAnimate module (versions >=1.2) supports staggering animations and the stagger effect can be
 * performed by creating a **ng-EVENT-stagger** CSS class and attaching that class to the base CSS class used for
 * the animation. The style property expected within the stagger class can either be a **transition-delay** or an
 * **animation-delay** property (or both if your animation contains both transitions and keyframe animations).
 *
 * ```css
 * .my-animation.ng-enter {
 *   /&#42; standard transition code &#42;/
 *   transition: 1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter-stagger {
 *   /&#42; this will have a 100ms delay between each successive leave animation &#42;/
 *   transition-delay: 0.1s;
 *
 *   /&#42; in case the stagger doesn't work then the duration value
 *    must be set to 0 to avoid an accidental CSS inheritance &#42;/
 *   transition-duration: 0s;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   /&#42; standard transition styles &#42;/
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Staggering animations work by default in ngRepeat (so long as the CSS class is defined). Outside of ngRepeat, to use staggering animations
 * on your own, they can be triggered by firing multiple calls to the same event on $animate. However, the restrictions surrounding this
 * are that each of the elements must have the same CSS className value as well as the same parent element. A stagger operation
 * will also be reset if one or more animation frames have passed since the multiple calls to `$animate` were fired.
 *
 * The following code will issue the **ng-leave-stagger** event on the element provided:
 *
 * ```js
 * var kids = parent.children();
 *
 * $animate.leave(kids[0]); //stagger index=0
 * $animate.leave(kids[1]); //stagger index=1
 * $animate.leave(kids[2]); //stagger index=2
 * $animate.leave(kids[3]); //stagger index=3
 * $animate.leave(kids[4]); //stagger index=4
 *
 * window.requestAnimationFrame(function() {
 *   //stagger has reset itself
 *   $animate.leave(kids[5]); //stagger index=0
 *   $animate.leave(kids[6]); //stagger index=1
 *
 *   $scope.$digest();
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Stagger animations are currently only supported within CSS-defined animations.
 *
 * ## JavaScript-based Animations
 *
 * ngAnimate also allows for animations to be consumed by JavaScript code. The approach is similar to CSS-based animations (where there is a shared
 * CSS class that is referenced in our HTML code) but in addition we need to register the JavaScript animation on the module. By making use of the
 * `module.animation()` module function we can register the ainmation.
 *
 * Let's see an example of a enter/leave animation using `ngRepeat`:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-repeat="item in items" class="slide">
 *   {{ item }}
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * See the **slide** CSS class? Let's use that class to define an animation that we'll structure in our module code by using `module.animation`:
 *
 * ```js
 * myModule.animation('.slide', [function() {
 *   return {
 *     // make note that other events (like addClass/removeClass)
 *     // have different function input parameters
 *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       jQuery(element).fadeIn(1000, doneFn);
 *
 *       // remember to call doneFn so that angular
 *       // knows that the animation has concluded
 *     },
 *
 *     move: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       jQuery(element).fadeIn(1000, doneFn);
 *     },
 *
 *     leave: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       jQuery(element).fadeOut(1000, doneFn);
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * The nice thing about JS-based animations is that we can inject other services and make use of advanced animation libraries such as
 * greensock.js and velocity.js.
 *
 * If our animation code class-based (meaning that something like `ngClass`, `ngHide` and `ngShow` triggers it) then we can still define
 * our animations inside of the same registered animation, however, the function input arguments are a bit different:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-class="color" class="colorful">
 *   this box is moody
 * </div>
 * <button ng-click="color='red'">Change to red</button>
 * <button ng-click="color='blue'">Change to blue</button>
 * <button ng-click="color='green'">Change to green</button>
 * ```
 *
 * ```js
 * myModule.animation('.colorful', [function() {
 *   return {
 *     addClass: function(element, className, doneFn) {
 *       // do some cool animation and call the doneFn
 *     },
 *     removeClass: function(element, className, doneFn) {
 *       // do some cool animation and call the doneFn
 *     },
 *     setClass: function(element, addedClass, removedClass, doneFn) {
 *       // do some cool animation and call the doneFn
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * ## CSS + JS Animations Together
 *
 * AngularJS 1.4 and higher has taken steps to make the amalgamation of CSS and JS animations more flexible. However, unlike earlier versions of Angular,
 * defining CSS and JS animations to work off of the same CSS class will not work anymore. Therefore example below will only result in **JS animations taking
 * charge of the animation**:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-if="bool" class="slide">
 *   Slide in and out
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * ```js
 * myModule.animation('.slide', [function() {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       jQuery(element).slideIn(1000, doneFn);
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * ```css
 * .slide.ng-enter {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   transform:translateY(-100px);
 * }
 * .slide.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   transform:translateY(0);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Does this mean that CSS and JS animations cannot be used together? Do JS-based animations always have higher priority? We can suppliment for the
 * lack of CSS animations by making use of the `$animateCss` service to trigger our own tweaked-out, CSS-based animations directly from
 * our own JS-based animation code:
 *
 * ```js
 * myModule.animation('.slide', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       var animation = $animateCss(element, {
 *         event: 'enter'
 *       });
 *
 *       if (animation) {
 *         // this will trigger `.slide.ng-enter` and `.slide.ng-enter-active`.
 *         var runner = animation.start();
 *         runner.done(doneFn);
 *       } else { //no CSS animation was detected
 *         doneFn();
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * The nice thing here is that we can save bandwidth by sticking to our CSS-based animation code and we don't need to rely on a 3rd-party animation framework.
 *
 * The `$animateCss` service is very powerful since we can feed in all kinds of extra properties that will be evaluated and fed into a CSS transition or
 * keyframe animation. For example if we wanted to animate the height of an element while adding and removing classes then we can do so by providing that
 * data into `$animateCss` directly:
 *
 * ```js
 * myModule.animation('.slide', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       var animation = $animateCss(element, {
 *         event: 'enter',
 *         addClass: 'maroon-setting',
 *         from: { height:0 },
 *         to: { height: 200 }
 *       });
 *
 *       if (animation) {
 *         animation.start().done(doneFn);
 *       } else {
 *         doneFn();
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * Now we can fill in the rest via our transition CSS code:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; the transition tells ngAnimate to make the animation happen &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-enter { transition:0.5s linear all; }
 *
 * /&#42; this extra CSS class will be absorbed into the transition
 * since the $animateCss code is adding the class &#42;/
 * .maroon-setting { background:red; }
 * ```
 *
 * And `$animateCss` will figure out the rest. Just make sure to have the `done()` callback fire the `doneFn` function to signal when the animation is over.
 *
 * To learn more about what's possible be sure to visit the {@link ngAnimate.$animateCss $animateCss service}.
 *
 *
 * ## Using $animate in your directive code
 *
 * So far we've explored how to feed in animations into an Angular application, but how do we trigger animations within our own directives in our application?
 * By injecting the `$animate` service into our directive code, we can trigger structural and class-based hooks which can then be consumed by animations. Let's
 * imagine we have a greeting box that shows and hides itself when the data changes
 *
 * ```html
 * <greeing-box active="onOrOff">Hi there</greeting-box>
 * ```
 *
 * ```js
 * ngModule.directive('greetingBox', ['$animate', function($animate) {
 *   return function(scope, element, attrs) {
 *     attrs.$observe('active', function(value) {
 *       value ? $animate.addClass(element, 'on') ? $animate.removeClass(element, 'on');
 *     });
 *   });
 * }]);
 * ```
 *
 * Now the `on` CSS class is added and removed on the greeting box component. Now if we add a CSS class on top of the greeting box element
 * in our HTML code then we can trigger a CSS or JS animation to happen.
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; normally we would create a CSS class to reference on the element &#42;/
 * [greeting-box].on { transition:0.5s linear all; background:green; color:white; }
 * ```
 *
 * The `$animate` service contains a variety of other methods like `enter`, `leave`, `animate` and `setClass`. To learn more about what's
 * possible be sure to visit the {@link ng.$animate $animate service API page}.
 *
 *
 * ### Preventing Collisions With Third Party Libraries
 *
 * Some third-party frameworks place animation duration defaults across many element or className
 * selectors in order to make their code small and reuseable. This can lead to issues with ngAnimate, which
 * is expecting actual animations on these elements and has to wait for their completion.
 *
 * You can prevent this unwanted behavior by using a prefix on all your animation classes:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; prefixed with animate- &#42;/
 * .animate-fade-add.animate-fade-add-active {
 *   transition:1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You then configure `$animate` to enforce this prefix:
 *
 * ```js
 * $animateProvider.classNameFilter(/animate-/);
 * ```
 *
 * This also may provide your application with a speed boost since only specific elements containing CSS class prefix
 * will be evaluated for animation when any DOM changes occur in the application.
 *
 * ## Callbacks and Promises
 *
 * When `$animate` is called it returns a promise that can be used to capture when the animation has ended. Therefore if we were to trigger
 * an animation (within our directive code) then we can continue performing directive and scope related activities after the animation has
 * ended by chaining onto the returned promise that animation method returns.
 *
 * ```js
 * // somewhere within the depths of the directive
 * $animate.enter(element, parent).then(function() {
 *   //the animation has completed
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * (Note that earlier versions of Angular prior to v1.4 required the promise code to be wrapped using `$scope.$apply(...)`. This is not the case
 * anymore.)
 *
 * In addition to the animation promise, we can also make use of animation-related callbacks within our directives and controller code by registering
 * an event listener using the `$animate` service. Let's say for example that an animation was triggered on our view
 * routing controller to hook into that:
 *
 * ```js
 * ngModule.controller('HomePageController', ['$animate', function($animate) {
 *   $animate.on('enter', ngViewElement, function(element) {
 *     // the animation for this route has completed
 *   }]);
 * }])
 * ```
 *
 * (Note that you will need to trigger a digest within the callback to get angular to notice any scope-related changes.)
