    /**
     * @ngdoc object
     * @name ngTouch.$swipe
     *
     * @description
     * The `$swipe` service is a service that abstracts the messier details of hold-and-drag swipe
     * behavior, to make implementing swipe-related directives more convenient.
     *
     * Requires the {@link ngTouch `ngTouch`} module to be installed.
     *
     * `$swipe` is used by the `ngSwipeLeft` and `ngSwipeRight` directives in `ngTouch`, and by
     * `ngCarousel` in a separate component.
     *
     * # Usage
     * The `$swipe` service is an object with a single method: `bind`. `bind` takes an element
     * which is to be watched for swipes, and an object with four handler functions. See the
     * documentation for `bind` below.

     *
     * @description
     * The main method of `$swipe`. It takes an element to be watched for swipe motions, and an
     * object containing event handlers.
     *
     * The four events are `start`, `move`, `end`, and `cancel`. `start`, `move`, and `end`
     * receive as a parameter a coordinates object of the form `{ x: 150, y: 310 }`.
     *
     * `start` is called on either `mousedown` or `touchstart`. After this event, `$swipe` is
     * watching for `touchmove` or `mousemove` events. These events are ignored until the total
     * distance moved in either dimension exceeds a small threshold.
     *
     * Once this threshold is exceeded, either the horizontal or vertical delta is greater.
     * - If the horizontal distance is greater, this is a swipe and `move` and `end` events follow.
     * - If the vertical distance is greater, this is a scroll, and we let the browser take over.
     *   A `cancel` event is sent.
     *
     * `move` is called on `mousemove` and `touchmove` after the above logic has determined that
     * a swipe is in progress.
     *
     * `end` is called when a swipe is successfully completed with a `touchend` or `mouseup`.
     *
     * `cancel` is called either on a `touchcancel` from the browser, or when we begin scrolling
     * as described above.
