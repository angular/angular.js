/**
 * DESIGN NOTES
 *
 * The design decisions behind the scope are heavily favored for speed and memory consumption.
 *
 * The typical use of scope is to watch the expressions, which most of the time return the same
 * value as last time so we optimize the operation.
 *
 * Closures construction is expensive in terms of speed as well as memory:
 *   - No closures, instead use prototypical inheritance for API
 *   - Internal state needs to be stored on scope directly, which means that private state is
 *     exposed as $$____ properties
 *
 * Loop operations are optimized by using while(count--) { ... }
 *   - this means that in order to keep the same order of execution as addition we have to add
 *     items to the array at the beginning (unshift) instead of at the end (push)
 *
 * Child scopes are created and removed often
 *   - Using an array would be slow since inserts in middle are expensive so we use linked list
 *
 * There are few watches then a lot of observers. This is why you don't want the observer to be
 * implemented in the same way as watch. Watch requires return of initialization function which
 * are expensive to construct.

       * Registers a `listener` callback to be executed whenever the `watchExpression` changes.
       *
       * - The `watchExpression` is called on every call to {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest
       *   $digest()} and should return the value that will be watched. (Since
       *   {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest()} reruns when it detects changes the
       *   `watchExpression` can execute multiple times per
       *   {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest()} and should be idempotent.)
       * - The `listener` is called only when the value from the current `watchExpression` and the
       *   previous call to `watchExpression` are not equal (with the exception of the initial run,
       *   see below). Inequality is determined according to reference inequality,
       *   [strict comparison](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators)
       *    via the `!==` Javascript operator, unless `objectEquality == true`
       *   (see next point)
       * - When `objectEquality == true`, inequality of the `watchExpression` is determined
       *   according to the {@link angular.equals} function. To save the value of the object for
       *   later comparison, the {@link angular.copy} function is used. This therefore means that
       *   watching complex objects will have adverse memory and performance implications.
       * - The watch `listener` may change the model, which may trigger other `listener`s to fire.
       *   This is achieved by rerunning the watchers until no changes are detected. The rerun
       *   iteration limit is 10 to prevent an infinite loop deadlock.
       *
       *
       * If you want to be notified whenever {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} is called,
       * you can register a `watchExpression` function with no `listener`. (Since `watchExpression`
       * can execute multiple times per {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} cycle when a
       * change is detected, be prepared for multiple calls to your listener.)
       *
       * After a watcher is registered with the scope, the `listener` fn is called asynchronously
       * (via {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$evalAsync $evalAsync}) to initialize the
       * watcher. In rare cases, this is undesirable because the listener is called when the result
       * of `watchExpression` didn't change. To detect this scenario within the `listener` fn, you
       * can compare the `newVal` and `oldVal`. If these two values are identical (`===`) then the
       * listener was called due to initialization.
       *
       *
       *

       * ```js
           // let's assume that scope was dependency injected as the $rootScope

           // but now it will not be called unless the value changes

       * @ngdoc method
       * @name $rootScope.Scope#$digest
       * @kind function
       *
       * @description
       * Processes all of the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watchers} of the current scope and
       * its children. Because a {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watcher}'s listener can change
       * the model, the `$digest()` keeps calling the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watchers}
       * until no more listeners are firing. This means that it is possible to get into an infinite
       * loop. This function will throw `'Maximum iteration limit exceeded.'` if the number of
       * iterations exceeds 10.
       *
       * Usually, you don't call `$digest()` directly in
       * {@link ng.directive:ngController controllers} or in
       * {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive directives}.
       * Instead, you should call {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$apply $apply()} (typically from within
       * a {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive directive}), which will force a `$digest()`.
       *
       * If you want to be notified whenever `$digest()` is called,
       * you can register a `watchExpression` function with
       * {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch $watch()} with no `listener`.
       *
       * In unit tests, you may need to call `$digest()` to simulate the scope life cycle.
       *
       * # Example
       * ```js
           var scope = ...;
           scope.name = 'misko';
           scope.counter = 0;

           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(0);
           scope.$watch('name', function(newValue, oldValue) {
             scope.counter = scope.counter + 1;
           });
           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(0);

           scope.$digest();
           // the listener is always called during the first $digest loop after it was registered
           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(1);

           scope.$digest();
           // but now it will not be called unless the value changes

       * @description
       * `$apply()` is used to execute an expression in angular from outside of the angular
       * framework. (For example from browser DOM events, setTimeout, XHR or third party libraries).
       * Because we are calling into the angular framework we need to perform proper scope life
       * cycle of {@link ng.$exceptionHandler exception handling},
       * {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest executing watches}.
       *
       * ## Life cycle
       *
       * # Pseudo-Code of `$apply()`
       * ```js
           function $apply(expr) {
             try {
               return $eval(expr);
             } catch (e) {
               $exceptionHandler(e);
             } finally {
               $root.$digest();
             }
           }
       * ```
       *
       *
       * Scope's `$apply()` method transitions through the following stages:
       *
       * 1. The {@link guide/expression expression} is executed using the
       *    {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$eval $eval()} method.
       * 2. Any exceptions from the execution of the expression are forwarded to the
       *    {@link ng.$exceptionHandler $exceptionHandler} service.
       * 3. The {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watch} listeners are fired immediately after the
       *    expression was executed using the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest()} method.
       *
       *
       * @param {(string|function())=} exp An angular expression to be executed.
       *
       *    - `string`: execute using the rules as defined in {@link guide/expression expression}.
       *    - `function(scope)`: execute the function with current `scope` parameter.
       *
       * @returns {*} The result of evaluating the expression.

       *   - `name` - `{string}`: name of the event.
       *   - `stopPropagation` - `{function=}`: calling `stopPropagation` function will cancel
       *     further event propagation (available only for events that were `$emit`-ed).
       *   - `preventDefault` - `{function}`: calling `preventDefault` sets `defaultPrevented` flag
       *     to true.
       *   - `defaultPrevented` - `{boolean}`: true if `preventDefault` was called.
       *
       * @param {string} name Event name to listen on.
