/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngRepeat
 * @multiElement
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngRepeat` directive instantiates a template once per item from a collection. Each template
 * instance gets its own scope, where the given loop variable is set to the current collection item,
 * and `$index` is set to the item index or key.
 *
 * Special properties are exposed on the local scope of each template instance, including:
 *
 * | Variable  | Type            | Details                                                                     |
 * |-----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | `$index`  | {@type number}  | iterator offset of the repeated element (0..length-1)                       |
 * | `$first`  | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is first in the iterator.                      |
 * | `$middle` | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is between the first and last in the iterator. |
 * | `$last`   | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is last in the iterator.                       |
 * | `$even`   | {@type boolean} | true if the iterator position `$index` is even (otherwise false).           |
 * | `$odd`    | {@type boolean} | true if the iterator position `$index` is odd (otherwise false).            |
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 *   Creating aliases for these properties is possible with {@link ng.directive:ngInit `ngInit`}.
 *   This may be useful when, for instance, nesting ngRepeats.
 * </div>
 *
 *
 * # Iterating over object properties
 *
 * It is possible to get `ngRepeat` to iterate over the properties of an object using the following
 * syntax:
 *
 * ```js
 * <div ng-repeat="(key, value) in myObj"> ... </div>
 * ```
 *
 * You need to be aware that the JavaScript specification does not define the order of keys
 * returned for an object. (To mitigate this in Angular 1.3 the `ngRepeat` directive
 * used to sort the keys alphabetically.)
 *
 * Version 1.4 removed the alphabetic sorting. We now rely on the order returned by the browser
 * when running `for key in myObj`. It seems that browsers generally follow the strategy of providing
 * keys in the order in which they were defined, although there are exceptions when keys are deleted
 * and reinstated. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete#Cross-browser_issues
 *
 * If this is not desired, the recommended workaround is to convert your object into an array
 * that is sorted into the order that you prefer before providing it to `ngRepeat`.  You could
 * do this with a filter such as [toArrayFilter](http://ngmodules.org/modules/angular-toArrayFilter)
 * or implement a `$watch` on the object yourself.
 *
 *
 * # Tracking and Duplicates
 *
 * When the contents of the collection change, `ngRepeat` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:
 *
 * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.
 * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.
 * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.
 *
 * By default, `ngRepeat` does not allow duplicate items in arrays. This is because when
 * there are duplicates, it is not possible to maintain a one-to-one mapping between collection
 * items and DOM elements.
 *
 * If you do need to repeat duplicate items, you can substitute the default tracking behavior
 * with your own using the `track by` expression.
 *
 * For example, you may track items by the index of each item in the collection, using the
 * special scope property `$index`:
 * ```html
 *    <div ng-repeat="n in [42, 42, 43, 43] track by $index">
 *      {{n}}
 *    </div>
 * ```
 *
 * You may use arbitrary expressions in `track by`, including references to custom functions
 * on the scope:
 * ```html
 *    <div ng-repeat="n in [42, 42, 43, 43] track by myTrackingFunction(n)">
 *      {{n}}
 *    </div>
 * ```
 *
 * If you are working with objects that have an identifier property, you can track
 * by the identifier instead of the whole object. Should you reload your data later, `ngRepeat`
 * will not have to rebuild the DOM elements for items it has already rendered, even if the
 * JavaScript objects in the collection have been substituted for new ones:
 * ```html
 *    <div ng-repeat="model in collection track by model.id">
 *      {{model.name}}
 *    </div>
 * ```
 *
 * When no `track by` expression is provided, it is equivalent to tracking by the built-in
 * `$id` function, which tracks items by their identity:
 * ```html
 *    <div ng-repeat="obj in collection track by $id(obj)">
 *      {{obj.prop}}
 *    </div>
 * ```
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** `track by` must always be the last expression:
 * </div>
 * ```
 * <div ng-repeat="model in collection | orderBy: 'id' as filtered_result track by model.id">
 *     {{model.name}}
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * # Special repeat start and end points
 * To repeat a series of elements instead of just one parent element, ngRepeat (as well as other ng directives) supports extending
 * the range of the repeater by defining explicit start and end points by using **ng-repeat-start** and **ng-repeat-end** respectively.
 * The **ng-repeat-start** directive works the same as **ng-repeat**, but will repeat all the HTML code (including the tag it's defined on)
 * up to and including the ending HTML tag where **ng-repeat-end** is placed.
 *
 * The example below makes use of this feature:
 * ```html
 *   <header ng-repeat-start="item in items">
 *     Header {{ item }}
 *   </header>
 *   <div class="body">
 *     Body {{ item }}
 *   </div>
 *   <footer ng-repeat-end>
 *     Footer {{ item }}
 *   </footer>
 * ```
 *
 * And with an input of {@type ['A','B']} for the items variable in the example above, the output will evaluate to:
 * ```html
 *   <header>
 *     Header A
 *   </header>
 *   <div class="body">
 *     Body A
 *   </div>
 *   <footer>
 *     Footer A
 *   </footer>
 *   <header>
 *     Header B
 *   </header>
 *   <div class="body">
 *     Body B
 *   </div>
 *   <footer>
 *     Footer B
 *   </footer>
 * ```
 *
 * The custom start and end points for ngRepeat also support all other HTML directive syntax flavors provided in AngularJS (such
 * as **data-ng-repeat-start**, **x-ng-repeat-start** and **ng:repeat-start**).
 *
 * @animations
 * **.enter** - when a new item is added to the list or when an item is revealed after a filter
 *
 * **.leave** - when an item is removed from the list or when an item is filtered out
 *
 * **.move** - when an adjacent item is filtered out causing a reorder or when the item contents are reordered
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @scope
 * @priority 1000
 * @param {repeat_expression} ngRepeat The expression indicating how to enumerate a collection. These
 *   formats are currently supported:
 *
 *   * `variable in expression` – where variable is the user defined loop variable and `expression`
 *     is a scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.
 *
 *     For example: `album in artist.albums`.
 *
 *   * `(key, value) in expression` – where `key` and `value` can be any user defined identifiers,
 *     and `expression` is the scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.
 *
 *     For example: `(name, age) in {'adam':10, 'amalie':12}`.
 *
 *   * `variable in expression track by tracking_expression` – You can also provide an optional tracking expression
 *     which can be used to associate the objects in the collection with the DOM elements. If no tracking expression
 *     is specified, ng-repeat associates elements by identity. It is an error to have
 *     more than one tracking expression value resolve to the same key. (This would mean that two distinct objects are
 *     mapped to the same DOM element, which is not possible.)
 *
 *     Note that the tracking expression must come last, after any filters, and the alias expression.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items` is equivalent to `item in items track by $id(item)`. This implies that the DOM elements
 *     will be associated by item identity in the array.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items track by $id(item)`. A built in `$id()` function can be used to assign a unique
 *     `$$hashKey` property to each item in the array. This property is then used as a key to associated DOM elements
 *     with the corresponding item in the array by identity. Moving the same object in array would move the DOM
 *     element in the same way in the DOM.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items track by item.id` is a typical pattern when the items come from the database. In this
 *     case the object identity does not matter. Two objects are considered equivalent as long as their `id`
 *     property is same.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items | filter:searchText track by item.id` is a pattern that might be used to apply a filter
 *     to items in conjunction with a tracking expression.
 *
 *   * `variable in expression as alias_expression` – You can also provide an optional alias expression which will then store the
 *     intermediate results of the repeater after the filters have been applied. Typically this is used to render a special message
 *     when a filter is active on the repeater, but the filtered result set is empty.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items | filter:x as results` will store the fragment of the repeated items as `results`, but only after
 *     the items have been processed through the filter.
 *
 *     Please note that `as [variable name] is not an operator but rather a part of ngRepeat micro-syntax so it can be used only at the end
 *     (and not as operator, inside an expression).
 *
 *     For example: `item in items | filter : x | orderBy : order | limitTo : limit as results` .
 *
 * @example
 * This example initializes the scope to a list of names and
 * then uses `ngRepeat` to display every person:
