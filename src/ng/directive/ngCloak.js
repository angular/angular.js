/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ng.directive:ngCloak
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngCloak` directive is used to prevent the Angular html template from being briefly
 * displayed by the browser in its raw (uncompiled) form while your application is loading. Use this
 * directive to avoid the undesirable flicker effect caused by the html template display.
 *
 * The directive can be applied to the `<body>` element, but typically a fine-grained application is
 * preferred in order to benefit from progressive rendering of the browser view.
 *
 * `ngCloak` works in cooperation with a css rule that is embedded within `angular.js` and
 *  `angular.min.js` files. Following is the css rule:
 *
 * <pre>
 * [ng\:cloak], [ng-cloak], [data-ng-cloak], [x-ng-cloak], .ng-cloak, .x-ng-cloak {
 *   display: none;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * When this css rule is loaded by the browser, all html elements (including their children) that
 * are tagged with the `ng-cloak` directive are hidden. When Angular comes across this directive
 * during the compilation of the template it deletes the `ngCloak` element attribute, which
 * makes the compiled element visible.
 *
 * For the best result, `angular.js` script must be loaded in the head section of the html file;
 * alternatively, the css rule (above) must be included in the external stylesheet of the
 * application.
 *
 * Legacy browsers, like IE7, do not provide attribute selector support (added in CSS 2.1) so they
 * cannot match the `[ng\:cloak]` selector. To work around this limitation, you must add the css
 * class `ngCloak` in addition to `ngCloak` directive as shown in the example below.
 *
 * @element ANY
 *
 * @example
   <doc:example>
     <doc:source>
        <div id="template1" ng-cloak>{{ 'hello' }}</div>
        <div id="template2" ng-cloak class="ng-cloak">{{ 'hello IE7' }}</div>
     </doc:source>
     <doc:scenario>
       it('should remove the template directive and css class', function() {
         expect(element('.doc-example-live #template1').attr('ng-cloak')).
           not().toBeDefined();
         expect(element('.doc-example-live #template2').attr('ng-cloak')).
           not().toBeDefined();
       });
     </doc:scenario>
   </doc:example>
