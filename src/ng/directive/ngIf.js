/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngIf
 * @restrict A
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngIf` directive removes or recreates a portion of the DOM tree based on an
 * {expression}. If the expression assigned to `ngIf` evaluates to a false
 * value then the element is removed from the DOM, otherwise a clone of the
 * element is reinserted into the DOM.
 *
 * `ngIf` differs from `ngShow` and `ngHide` in that `ngIf` completely removes and recreates the
 * element in the DOM rather than changing its visibility via the `display` css property.  A common
 * case when this difference is significant is when using css selectors that rely on an element's
 * position within the DOM, such as the `:first-child` or `:last-child` pseudo-classes.
 *
 * Note that when an element is removed using `ngIf` its scope is destroyed and a new scope
 * is created when the element is restored.  The scope created within `ngIf` inherits from
 * its parent scope using
 * [prototypal inheritance](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/The-Nuances-of-Scope-Prototypal-Inheritance).
 * An important implication of this is if `ngModel` is used within `ngIf` to bind to
 * a javascript primitive defined in the parent scope. In this case any modifications made to the
 * variable within the child scope will override (hide) the value in the parent scope.
 *
 * Also, `ngIf` recreates elements using their compiled state. An example of this behavior
 * is if an element's class attribute is directly modified after it's compiled, using something like
 * jQuery's `.addClass()` method, and the element is later removed. When `ngIf` recreates the element
 * the added class will be lost because the original compiled state is used to regenerate the element.
 *
 * Additionally, you can provide animations via the `ngAnimate` module to animate the `enter`
 * and `leave` effects.
 *
 * @animations
 * enter - happens just after the ngIf contents change and a new DOM element is created and injected into the ngIf container
 * leave - happens just before the ngIf contents are removed from the DOM
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @scope
 * @priority 600
 * @param {expression} ngIf If the {@link guide/expression expression} is falsy then
 *     the element is removed from the DOM tree. If it is truthy a copy of the compiled
 *     element is added to the DOM tree.
 *
