/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ng.directive:ngIf
 * @restrict A
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngIf` directive removes and recreates a portion of the DOM tree (HTML)
 * conditionally based on **"falsy"** and **"truthy"** values, respectively, evaluated within
 * an {expression}. In other words, if the expression assigned to **ngIf evaluates to a false
 * value** then **the element is removed from the DOM** and **if true** then **a clone of the
 * element is reinserted into the DOM**.
 *
 * `ngIf` differs from `ngShow` and `ngHide` in that `ngIf` completely removes and recreates the
 * element in the DOM rather than changing its visibility via the `display` css property.  A common
 * case when this difference is significant is when using css selectors that rely on an element's
 * position within the DOM (HTML), such as the `:first-child` or `:last-child` pseudo-classes.
 *
 * Note that **when an element is removed using ngIf its scope is destroyed** and **a new scope
 * is created when the element is restored**.  The scope created within `ngIf` inherits from 
 * its parent scope using
 * {@link https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/The-Nuances-of-Scope-Prototypal-Inheritance prototypal inheritance}.
 * An important implication of this is if `ngModel` is used within `ngIf` to bind to
 * a javascript primitive defined in the parent scope. In this case any modifications made to the
 * variable within the child scope will override (hide) the value in the parent scope.
 *
 * Also, `ngIf` recreates elements using their compiled state. An example scenario of this behavior
 * is if an element's class attribute is directly modified after it's compiled, using something like 
 * jQuery's `.addClass()` method, and the element is later removed. When `ngIf` recreates the element
 * the added class will be lost because the original compiled state is used to regenerate the element.
 *
 * Additionally, you can provide animations via the ngAnimate attribute to animate the **enter**
 * and **leave** effects.
 *
 * @animations
 * enter - happens just after the ngIf contents change and a new DOM element is created and injected into the ngIf container
 * leave - happens just before the ngIf contents are removed from the DOM
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @scope
 * @param {expression} ngIf If the {@link guide/expression expression} is falsy then
 *     the element is removed from the DOM tree (HTML).
