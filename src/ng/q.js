 * @ngdoc service
 * @name ng.$q
 * @requires $rootScope
 *
 * @description
 * A promise/deferred implementation inspired by [Kris Kowal's Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q).
 *
 * [The CommonJS Promise proposal](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises) describes a promise as an
 * interface for interacting with an object that represents the result of an action that is
 * performed asynchronously, and may or may not be finished at any given point in time.
 *
 * From the perspective of dealing with error handling, deferred and promise APIs are to
 * asynchronous programming what `try`, `catch` and `throw` keywords are to synchronous programming.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   // for the purpose of this example let's assume that variables `$q` and `scope` are
 *   // available in the current lexical scope (they could have been injected or passed in).
 *
 *   function asyncGreet(name) {
 *     var deferred = $q.defer();
 *
 *     setTimeout(function() {
 *       // since this fn executes async in a future turn of the event loop, we need to wrap
 *       // our code into an $apply call so that the model changes are properly observed.
 *       scope.$apply(function() {
 *         if (okToGreet(name)) {
 *           deferred.resolve('Hello, ' + name + '!');
 *         } else {
 *           deferred.reject('Greeting ' + name + ' is not allowed.');
 *         }
 *       });
 *     }, 1000);
 *
 *     return deferred.promise;
 *   }
 *
 *   var promise = asyncGreet('Robin Hood');
 *   promise.then(function(greeting) {
 *     alert('Success: ' + greeting);
 *   }, function(reason) {
 *     alert('Failed: ' + reason);
 *   });
 * </pre>
 *
 * At first it might not be obvious why this extra complexity is worth the trouble. The payoff
 * comes in the way of
 * [guarantees that promise and deferred APIs make](https://github.com/kriskowal/uncommonjs/blob/master/promises/specification.md).
 *
 * Additionally the promise api allows for composition that is very hard to do with the
 * traditional callback ([CPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style)) approach.
 * For more on this please see the [Q documentation](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) especially the
 * section on serial or parallel joining of promises.
 *
 *
 * # The Deferred API
 *
 * A new instance of deferred is constructed by calling `$q.defer()`.
 *
 * The purpose of the deferred object is to expose the associated Promise instance as well as APIs
 * that can be used for signaling the successful or unsuccessful completion of the task.
 *
 * **Methods**
 *
 * - `resolve(value)` – resolves the derived promise with the `value`. If the value is a rejection
 *   constructed via `$q.reject`, the promise will be rejected instead.
 * - `reject(reason)` – rejects the derived promise with the `reason`. This is equivalent to
 *   resolving it with a rejection constructed via `$q.reject`.
 *
 * **Properties**
 *
 * - promise – `{Promise}` – promise object associated with this deferred.
 *
 *
 * # The Promise API
 *
 * A new promise instance is created when a deferred instance is created and can be retrieved by
 * calling `deferred.promise`.
 *
 * The purpose of the promise object is to allow for interested parties to get access to the result
 * of the deferred task when it completes.
 *
 * **Methods**
 *
 * - `then(successCallback, errorCallback)` – regardless of when the promise was or will be resolved
 *   or rejected calls one of the success or error callbacks asynchronously as soon as the result
 *   is available. The callbacks are called with a single argument the result or rejection reason.
 *
 *   This method *returns a new promise* which is resolved or rejected via the return value of the
 *   `successCallback` or `errorCallback`.
 *
 *
 * # Chaining promises
 *
 * Because calling `then` api of a promise returns a new derived promise, it is easily possible
 * to create a chain of promises:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   promiseB = promiseA.then(function(result) {
 *     return result + 1;
 *   });
 *
 *   // promiseB will be resolved immediately after promiseA is resolved and its value will be
 *   // the result of promiseA incremented by 1
 * </pre>
 *
 * It is possible to create chains of any length and since a promise can be resolved with another
 * promise (which will defer its resolution further), it is possible to pause/defer resolution of
 * the promises at any point in the chain. This makes it possible to implement powerful apis like
 * $http's response interceptors.
 *
 *
 * # Differences between Kris Kowal's Q and $q
 *
 *  There are three main differences:
 *
 * - $q is integrated with the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope} Scope model observation
 *   mechanism in angular, which means faster propagation of resolution or rejection into your
 *   models and avoiding unnecessary browser repaints, which would result in flickering UI.
 * - $q promises are recognized by the templating engine in angular, which means that in templates
 *   you can treat promises attached to a scope as if they were the resulting values.
 * - Q has many more features that $q, but that comes at a cost of bytes. $q is tiny, but contains
 *   all the important functionality needed for common async tasks.
 * 
 *  # Testing
 * 
 *  <pre>
 *    it('should simulate promise', inject(function($q, $rootScope) {
 *      var deferred = $q.defer();
 *      var promise = deferred.promise;
 *      var resolvedValue;
 * 
 *      promise.then(function(value) { resolvedValue = value; });
 *      expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();
 * 
 *      // Simulate resolving of promise
 *      deferred.resolve(123);
 *      // Note that the 'then' function does not get called synchronously.
 *      // This is because we want the promise API to always be async, whether or not
 *      // it got called synchronously or asynchronously.
 *      expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();
 * 
 *      // Propagate promise resolution to 'then' functions using $apply().
 *      $rootScope.$apply();
 *      expect(resolvedValue).toEqual(123);
 *    });
 *  </pre>
