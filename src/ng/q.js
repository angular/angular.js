/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $q
 * @requires $rootScope
 *
 * @description
 * A service that helps you run functions asynchronously, and use their return values (or exceptions)
 * when they are done processing.
 *
 * This is a [Promises/A+](https://promisesaplus.com/)-compliant implementation of promises/deferred
 * objects inspired by [Kris Kowal's Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q).
 *
 * $q can be used in two fashions --- one which is more similar to Kris Kowal's Q or jQuery's Deferred
 * implementations, and the other which resembles ES6 (ES2015) promises to some degree.
 *
 * # $q constructor
 *
 * The streamlined ES6 style promise is essentially just using $q as a constructor which takes a `resolver`
 * function as the first argument. This is similar to the native Promise implementation from ES6,
 * see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).
 *
 * While the constructor-style use is supported, not all of the supporting methods from ES6 promises are
 * available yet.
 *
 * It can be used like so:
 *
 * ```js
 *   // for the purpose of this example let's assume that variables `$q` and `okToGreet`
 *   // are available in the current lexical scope (they could have been injected or passed in).
 *
 *   function asyncGreet(name) {
 *     // perform some asynchronous operation, resolve or reject the promise when appropriate.
 *     return $q(function(resolve, reject) {
 *       setTimeout(function() {
 *         if (okToGreet(name)) {
 *           resolve('Hello, ' + name + '!');
 *         } else {
 *           reject('Greeting ' + name + ' is not allowed.');
 *         }
 *       }, 1000);
 *     });
 *   }
 *
 *   var promise = asyncGreet('Robin Hood');
 *   promise.then(function(greeting) {
 *     alert('Success: ' + greeting);
 *   }, function(reason) {
 *     alert('Failed: ' + reason);
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * Note: progress/notify callbacks are not currently supported via the ES6-style interface.
 *
 * Note: unlike ES6 behavior, an exception thrown in the constructor function will NOT implicitly reject the promise.
 *
 * However, the more traditional CommonJS-style usage is still available, and documented below.
 *
 * [The CommonJS Promise proposal](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises) describes a promise as an
 * interface for interacting with an object that represents the result of an action that is
 * performed asynchronously, and may or may not be finished at any given point in time.
 *
 * From the perspective of dealing with error handling, deferred and promise APIs are to
 * asynchronous programming what `try`, `catch` and `throw` keywords are to synchronous programming.
 *
 * ```js
 *   // for the purpose of this example let's assume that variables `$q` and `okToGreet`
 *   // are available in the current lexical scope (they could have been injected or passed in).
 *
 *   function asyncGreet(name) {
 *     var deferred = $q.defer();
 *
 *     setTimeout(function() {
 *       deferred.notify('About to greet ' + name + '.');
 *
 *       if (okToGreet(name)) {
 *         deferred.resolve('Hello, ' + name + '!');
 *       } else {
 *         deferred.reject('Greeting ' + name + ' is not allowed.');
 *       }
 *     }, 1000);
 *
 *     return deferred.promise;
 *   }
 *
 *   var promise = asyncGreet('Robin Hood');
 *   promise.then(function(greeting) {
 *     alert('Success: ' + greeting);
 *   }, function(reason) {
 *     alert('Failed: ' + reason);
 *   }, function(update) {
 *     alert('Got notification: ' + update);
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * At first it might not be obvious why this extra complexity is worth the trouble. The payoff
 * comes in the way of guarantees that promise and deferred APIs make, see
 * https://github.com/kriskowal/uncommonjs/blob/master/promises/specification.md.
 *
 * Additionally the promise api allows for composition that is very hard to do with the
 * traditional callback ([CPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style)) approach.
 * For more on this please see the [Q documentation](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) especially the
 * section on serial or parallel joining of promises.
 *
 * # The Deferred API
 *
 * A new instance of deferred is constructed by calling `$q.defer()`.
 *
 * The purpose of the deferred object is to expose the associated Promise instance as well as APIs
 * that can be used for signaling the successful or unsuccessful completion, as well as the status
 * of the task.
 *
 * **Methods**
 *
 * - `resolve(value)` – resolves the derived promise with the `value`. If the value is a rejection
 *   constructed via `$q.reject`, the promise will be rejected instead.
 * - `reject(reason)` – rejects the derived promise with the `reason`. This is equivalent to
 *   resolving it with a rejection constructed via `$q.reject`.
 * - `notify(value)` - provides updates on the status of the promise's execution. This may be called
 *   multiple times before the promise is either resolved or rejected.
 *
 * **Properties**
 *
 * - promise – `{Promise}` – promise object associated with this deferred.
 *
 *
 * # The Promise API
 *
 * A new promise instance is created when a deferred instance is created and can be retrieved by
 * calling `deferred.promise`.
 *
 * The purpose of the promise object is to allow for interested parties to get access to the result
 * of the deferred task when it completes.
 *
 * **Methods**
 *
 * - `then(successCallback, [errorCallback], [notifyCallback])` – regardless of when the promise was or
 *   will be resolved or rejected, `then` calls one of the success or error callbacks asynchronously
 *   as soon as the result is available. The callbacks are called with a single argument: the result
 *   or rejection reason. Additionally, the notify callback may be called zero or more times to
 *   provide a progress indication, before the promise is resolved or rejected.
 *
 *   This method *returns a new promise* which is resolved or rejected via the return value of the
 *   `successCallback`, `errorCallback` (unless that value is a promise, in which case it is resolved
 *   with the value which is resolved in that promise using
 *   [promise chaining](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/#toc-promises-queues)).
 *   It also notifies via the return value of the `notifyCallback` method. The promise cannot be
 *   resolved or rejected from the notifyCallback method. The errorCallback and notifyCallback
 *   arguments are optional.
 *
 * - `catch(errorCallback)` – shorthand for `promise.then(null, errorCallback)`
 *
 * - `finally(callback, notifyCallback)` – allows you to observe either the fulfillment or rejection of a promise,
 *   but to do so without modifying the final value. This is useful to release resources or do some
 *   clean-up that needs to be done whether the promise was rejected or resolved. See the [full
 *   specification](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#promisefinallycallback) for
 *   more information.
 *
 * # Chaining promises
 *
 * Because calling the `then` method of a promise returns a new derived promise, it is easily
 * possible to create a chain of promises:
 *
 * ```js
 *   promiseB = promiseA.then(function(result) {
 *     return result + 1;
 *   });
 *
 *   // promiseB will be resolved immediately after promiseA is resolved and its value
 *   // will be the result of promiseA incremented by 1
 * ```
 *
 * It is possible to create chains of any length and since a promise can be resolved with another
 * promise (which will defer its resolution further), it is possible to pause/defer resolution of
 * the promises at any point in the chain. This makes it possible to implement powerful APIs like
 * $http's response interceptors.
 *
 *
 * # Differences between Kris Kowal's Q and $q
 *
 *  There are two main differences:
 *
 * - $q is integrated with the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope} Scope model observation
 *   mechanism in angular, which means faster propagation of resolution or rejection into your
 *   models and avoiding unnecessary browser repaints, which would result in flickering UI.
 * - Q has many more features than $q, but that comes at a cost of bytes. $q is tiny, but contains
 *   all the important functionality needed for common async tasks.
 *
 * # Testing
 *
 *  ```js
 *    it('should simulate promise', inject(function($q, $rootScope) {
 *      var deferred = $q.defer();
 *      var promise = deferred.promise;
 *      var resolvedValue;
 *
 *      promise.then(function(value) { resolvedValue = value; });
 *      expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();
 *
 *      // Simulate resolving of promise
 *      deferred.resolve(123);
 *      // Note that the 'then' function does not get called synchronously.
 *      // This is because we want the promise API to always be async, whether or not
 *      // it got called synchronously or asynchronously.
 *      expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();
 *
 *      // Propagate promise resolution to 'then' functions using $apply().
 *      $rootScope.$apply();
 *      expect(resolvedValue).toEqual(123);
 *    }));
 *  ```
 *
 * @param {function(function, function)} resolver Function which is responsible for resolving or
 *   rejecting the newly created promise. The first parameter is a function which resolves the
 *   promise, the second parameter is a function which rejects the promise.
 *
 * @returns {Promise} The newly created promise.
