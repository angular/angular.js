# Testing Angular Applications

## Running unit tests

We recommend using jasmine and JsTestDriver for your unit tests/specs, but you are free to use
whatever works for you.

Requires java and a local or remote browser.

start scripts/test-server.sh
navigate your browser to http://localhost:9876/
click on one of the capture links (preferably the "strict" one)
run scripts/test.sh

## Continuous unit testing

Requires ruby and watchr gem.

start JSTD server and capture a browser as described above
start watchr as watchr scripts/watchr.rb
in a different window/tab/editor tail -f logs/jstd.log
edit files in app/ or src/ and save them
watch the log to see updates
There are many other ways to achieve the same effect. Feel free to use them if you prefer them
over watchr.

## End to end testing

angular ships with a baked-in end-to-end test runner that understands angular, your app and allows
you to write your tests with jasmine-like BDD syntax.

Requires a webserver, node.js or your backend server that hosts the angular static files.

create your end-to-end tests in test/e2e/scenarios.js
serve your project directory with your http/backend server or node.js + scripts/web-server.js
open http://localhost:port/test/e2e/runner.html in your browser
