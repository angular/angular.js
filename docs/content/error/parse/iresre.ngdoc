@ngdoc error
@name $parse:iresre
@fullName Invalid matching pattern for tagging private fields
@description

Occurs when a non-regexp expression is assigned as the
matching pattern used to tag private fields.

Example that will throw this error:

```
$parseProvider.restrictFieldsMatching('priv');
```

If you want to tag private fields with a 'priv' preffix
you should do this instead:
```
$parseProvider.restrictFieldsMatching(/priv/);
```
