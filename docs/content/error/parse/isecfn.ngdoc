@ngdoc error
@name $parse:isecfn
@fullName Referencing Function Disallowed
@description

Occurs when an expression attempts to access the 'Function' object (constructor for all functions in JavaScript).

Angular bans access to Function from within expressions since constructor access is a known way to execute arbitrary Javascript code.

To resolve this error, avoid Function access.
