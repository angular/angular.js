@ngdoc error
@name $injector:modulerr
@fullName Module Error
@description

This error occurs when a module fails to load due to some exception. The error
message above should provide additional context.

A common reason why the module fails to load is that you've forgotten to
include the file with the defined module or that the file couldn't be loaded.

### Using `ngRoute`

In AngularJS `1.2.0` and later, `ngRoute` has been moved to its own module.
If you are getting this error after upgrading to `1.2.x` or later, be sure that you've
installed {@link ngRoute `ngRoute`}.

### Monkey-patching AngularJS's `ng` module

This error can also occur if you have tried to add your own components to the `ng` module.
This has never been supported and from `1.3.0` it will actually trigger this error.
For instance the following code could trigger this error.

```js
angular.module('ng').filter('tel', function (){});
```

Instead create your own module and add it as a dependency to your application's top-level module.
