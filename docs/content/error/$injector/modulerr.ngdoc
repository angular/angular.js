@ngdoc error
@name $injector:modulerr
@fullName Module Error
@description

This error occurs when a module fails to load due to some exception. The error
message above should provide additional context as long as you're not running the minified version of Angular.

In AngularJS `1.2.0` and later, `ngRoute` has been moved to its own module.
If you are getting this error after upgrading to `1.2.x`, be sure that you've
installed {@link ngRoute `ngRoute`}.
