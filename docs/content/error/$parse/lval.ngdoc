@ngdoc error
@name $parse:lval
@fullName Trying to assign a value to a non l-value
@description

Occurs when an expression is trying to assign a value to a non-assignable expression.

This can happen if the left side of an assigment is not a valid reference to a variable
or property. E.g. In the following snippet `1+2` is not assignable.

```
(1+2) = 'hello';
```
