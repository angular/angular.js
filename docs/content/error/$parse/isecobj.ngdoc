@ngdoc error
@name $parse:isecobj
@fullName Referencing Object Disallowed
@description

Occurs when an expression attempts to access the 'Object' object (Root object in JavaScript).

Angular bans access to Object from within expressions since access is a known way to modify
the behaviour of existing objects.

To resolve this error, avoid Object access.
