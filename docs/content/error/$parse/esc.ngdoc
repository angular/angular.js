@ngdoc error
@name $parse:esc
@fullName Value cannot be escaped
@description

Occurs when the parser tries to escape a value that is not known.

This should never occur in practice. If it does then that indicates a programming
error in the AngularJS `$parse` service itself and should be reported as an issue
at https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues.
