@fullName Binding to Multiple Attribute
@description

Binding to the `multiple` attribute of `select` element is not supported since switching between multiple and single mode changes the {@link api/ng.directive:ngModel `ngModel`} object type from instance to array of instances which breaks the model semantics.

If you need to use different types of `select` elements in your template based on some variable, please use {@link api/ng.directive:ngIf ngIf} or {@link api/ng.directive:ngSwitch ngSwitch} directives to select one of them to be used at runtime.


Example with invalid usage:
```
<select ng-model="some.model" multiple="{{mode}}"></select>
```

Example that uses ngIf to pick one of the `select` elements based on a variable:
```
<select ng-if="mode == 'multiple'" ng-model="some.model" multiple></select>
<select ng-if="mode != 'multiple'" ng-model="some.model"></select>
```
