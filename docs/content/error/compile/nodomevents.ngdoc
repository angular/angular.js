@ngdoc error
@name $compile:nodomevents
@fullName Interpolated Event Attributes
@description

This error occurs when one tries to create a binding for event handler attributes like `onclick`, `onload`, `onsubmit`, etc.

There is no practical value in binding to these attributes and doing so only exposes your application to security vulnerabilities like XSS.
For these reasons binding to event handler attributes (all attributes that start with `on` and `formaction` attribute) is not supported.


An example code that would allow XSS vulnerability by evaluating user input in the window context could look like this:
```
<input ng-mode="username">
<div onclick="{{username}}">click me</div>
```

Since the `onclick` evaluates the value as JavaScript code in the window context, setting the `username` model to a value like `javascript:alert('PWND')` would result in script injection when the `div` is clicked.
