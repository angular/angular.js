@ngdoc error
@name $animate:nongcls
@fullName `ng-animate` class not allowed
@description

This error occurs, when trying to set `$animateProvider.classNameFilter()` to a RegExp containing
the reserved `ng-animate` class. Since `.ng-animate` will be added/removed by `$animate` itself,
using it as part of the `classNameFilter` RegExp is not allowed.
