@fullName Copying Window or Scope
@description

Copying Window or Scope instances is not supported because of cyclical and self
references. Avoid copying windows and scopes, as well as any other cyclical or
self-referential structures. Note that trying to deep copy an object containing
cyclical references that is neither a window nor a scope will cause infinite
recursion and a stack overflow.
