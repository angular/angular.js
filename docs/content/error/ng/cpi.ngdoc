@ngdoc error
@name ng:cpi
@fullName Bad Copy
@description

This error occurs when attempting to copy an object to itself. Calling {@link
angular.copy angular.copy} with a `destination` object deletes
all of the elements or properties on `destination` before copying to it. Copying
an object to itself is not supported. Make sure to check your calls to
`angular.copy` and avoid copying objects or arrays to themselves.
