@ngdoc error
@name ng:test
@fullName Testability Not Found
@description

AngularJS's testability helper, getTestability, requires a root element to be
passed in. This helps differentiate between different AngularJS apps on the same
page. This error is thrown when no injector is found for root element. It is
often because the root element is outside of the ng-app.
