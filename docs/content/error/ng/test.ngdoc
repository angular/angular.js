@ngdoc error
@name ng:test
@fullName Testability Not Found
@description

Angular's testability helper, getTestability, requires a root element to be
passed in. This helps differentiate between different Angular apps on the same
page. This error is thrown when no injector is found for root element. It is
often because the root element is outside of the ng-app.
