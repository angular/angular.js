@ngdoc error
@name ng:areq
@fullName Bad Argument
@description

AngularJS often asserts that certain values will be present and truthy using a
helper function. If the assertion fails, this error is thrown. To fix this problem,
make sure that the value the assertion expects is defined and truthy.
Check and make sure that provided controller name is exact, this may be a syntax error
as well and you have included app-name and check that the current controller is included in root html.
