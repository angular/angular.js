@ngdoc error
@name filter:notarray
@fullName Not an array
@description

This error occurs when {@link ng.filter filter} is not used with an array.
Filter must be used with an array so a subset of items can be returned.
The array can be initialized asynchronously so null or undefined won't throw this error.
