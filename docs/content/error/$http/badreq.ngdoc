@ngdoc error
@name $http:badreq
@fullName Bad Request Configuration
@description

This error occurs when the request configuration parameter passed to the {@link ng.$http `$http`} service is not a valid object.
`$http` expects a single parameter, the request configuration object, but received a parameter that was not an object or did not contain valid properties.

The error message should provide additional context such as the actual value of the parameter that was received.
If you passed a string parameter, perhaps you meant to call one of the shorthand methods on `$http` such as `$http.get(â€¦)`, etc.

To resolve this error, make sure you pass a valid request configuration object to `$http`.

For more information, see the {@link ng.$http `$http`} service API documentation.
