@fullName Controller is required.
@description

When using the `bindToController` feature of AngularJS, a directive is required
to have a Controller. A controller may be specified by adding a "controller"
property to the directive definition object. Its value should be either a
string, or an invokable object (a function, or an array whose last element is a
function).

For more information, see the {@link guide/directive directives guide}.
