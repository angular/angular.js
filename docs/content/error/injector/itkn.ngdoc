@ngdoc error
@name $injector:itkn
@fullName Bad Injection Token
@description

This error occurs when using a bad token as a dependency injection annotation.
Dependency injection annotation tokens should always be strings. Using any other
type will cause this error to be thrown.

Examples of code with bad injection tokens include:

```
var myCtrl = function ($scope, $http) { /* ... */ };
myCtrl.$inject = ['$scope', 42];

myAppModule.controller('MyCtrl', ['$scope', {}, function ($scope, $timeout) {
  // ...
}]);
```

The bad injection tokens are `42` in the first example and `{}` in the second.
To avoid the error, always use string literals for dependency injection annotation
tokens.

For an explanation of what injection annotations are and how to use them, refer
to the {@link guide/di Dependency Injection Guide}.
