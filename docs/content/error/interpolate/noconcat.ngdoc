@ngdoc error
@name $interpolate:noconcat
@fullName Multiple Expressions
@description

This error occurs when performing an interpolation that concatenates multiple
expressions when a trusted value is required. Concatenating expressions makes
it hard to reason about whether some combination of concatenated values are
unsafe to use and could easily lead to XSS.
