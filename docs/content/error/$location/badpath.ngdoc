@ngdoc error
@name $location:badpath
@fullName Invalid Path
@description

This error occurs when the path of a location contains invalid characters.
The most common fault is when the path starts with double slashes (`//`) or backslashes ('\\').
For example if the base path of an application is `https://a.b.c/` then the following path is
invalid `https://a.b.c///d/e/f`.
