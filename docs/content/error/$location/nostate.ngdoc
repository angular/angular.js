@ngdoc error
@name $location:nostate
@fullName History API state support is available only in HTML5 mode and only in browsers supporting HTML5 History API
@description

This error occurs when the {@link ng.$location#state $location.state} method is used when {@link ng.$locationProvider#html5Mode $locationProvider.html5Mode} is not turned on or the browser used doesn't support the HTML5 History API (for example, IE9 or Android 2.3).

To avoid this error, either drop support for those older browsers or avoid using this method.
