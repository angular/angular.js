@ngdoc error
@name $controller:noscp
@fullName Missing $scope object
@description

This error occurs when {@link api/ng.$controller $controller} service is called in order to instantiate a new controller but no scope is provided via `$scope` property of the locals map.

Example of incorrect usage that leads to this error:
```
$controller(MyController);
//or
$controller(MyController, {scope: newScope});
```

To fix the example above please provide a scope to the $controller call:

```
$controller(MyController, {$scope, newScope});
```

Please consult the {@link api/ng.$controller $controller} service api docs to learn more.
