@ngdoc error
@name $resource:badname
@fullName Cannot use hasOwnProperty as a parameter name
@description

Occurs when you try to use the name `hasOwnProperty` as a name of a parameter.
Generally, a name cannot be `hasOwnProperty` because it is used, internally, on a object
and allowing such a name would break lookups on this object.
