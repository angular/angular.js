@ngdoc error
@name $resource:badcfg
@fullName Response does not match configured parameter
@description

This error occurs when the {@link api/ngResource.$resource `$resource`} service expects a response that can be deserialized as an array, receives an object, or vice versa.
By default, all resource actions expect objects, except `query` which expects arrays.

To resolve this error, make sure your `$resource` configuration matches the actual format of the data returned from the server.

For more information, see the {@link api/ngResource.$resource `$resource`} API reference documentation.
