@ngdoc error
@name $cacheFactory:iid
@fullName Invalid ID
@description

This error occurs when trying to create a new `cache` object via {@link api/ng.$cacheFactory} with an ID that was already used to create another cache object.

To resolve the error please use a different cache ID when calling `$cacheFactory`.
