@ngdoc error
@name $sce:insecurl
@fullName Processing of a Resource from Untrusted Source Blocked
@description

AngularJS' {@link api/ng.$sce Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE)} mode (enabled by default) has blocked loading a resource from an insecure URL.

Typically, this would occur if you're attempting to load an Angular template from an untrusted source.
It's also possible that a custom directive threw this error for a similar reason.

Angular only loads templates from trusted URLs (by calling {@link api/ng.$sce#methods_getTrustedResourceUrl $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl} on the template URL).

By default, only URLs that belong to the same origin are trusted. These are urls with the same domain and protocol as the application document.

The {@link api/ng.directive:ngInclude ngInclude} directive and {@link guide/directive directives} that specify a `templateUrl` require a trusted resource URL.

To load templates from other domains and/or protocols, either adjust the {@link
api/ng.$sceDelegateProvider#methods_resourceUrlWhitelist whitelist}/ {@link
api/ng.$sceDelegateProvider#methods_resourceUrlBlacklist blacklist} or wrap the URL with a call to {@link
api/ng.$sce#methods_trustAsResourceUrl $sce.trustAsResourceUrl}.

**Note**: The browser's {@link
https://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_XMLHttpRequest Same Origin
Policy} and {@link http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/ Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)} policy apply
that may further restrict whether the template is successfully loaded.  (e.g.  neither cross-domain
requests won't work on all browsers nor `file://` requests on some browsers)
