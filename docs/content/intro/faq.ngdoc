#FAQ

### Why is this project called "angular"? Why is the namespace called "ng"?

Because HTML has angular brackets and "ng" sounds like "angular".

### Is <angular/> an HTML5 tag?

No, <angular/> is not an HTML5 tag. angular is an orthogonal project to HTML5; you can use the two
together.

### Is angular a {library, framework, DOM manipulation library, widget library, native plugin}?

No, angular is none of these. You don't call its functions, it does not call your functions,
it does not provide a way to manipulate DOM, but does provide primitives to create UI projections
of your data. There are lots of existing widget libraries which you can integrate with angular.
It is 100% JavaScript, 100% client side and compatible with both desktop and mobile browsers.

### Do I need to worry about security holes in angular?

Like with any technology, angular is not impervious to attack. angular does, however, provide
built-in protection from basic security holes including cross-site scripting and HTML injection
attacks. angular does round-trip escaping on all strings for you.

### Can I download the source, build, and host the angular environment locally?

Yes. See instructions in {@link intro.downloading downloading}.

### Is angular a templating system?

At the highest level, angular does look like a just another templating system. But there is one
important reason why angular templating system is different and makes it very good fit for
application development: bidirectional data binding. The template is compiled on the browser and
the compilation step produces a live view. This means you, the developer, don't need to write
code to constantly sync the view with the model and the model with the view as in other
templating systems.

### What browsers does angular work with?

Webkit-based browsers (Safari, Chrome, iPhone, Android, WebOS, BlackBerry 6), Firefox, IE6 and
above. Note that CSS only works on IE7 and above.

### What's angular's performance like?

angular takes ~300ms to load, render, and compile. In Chrome it uses about 2-5MB of memory. Your
app's performance will vary depending on how many bindings you use.

### How big is the angular bootstrap JS file that I need to include?

The size of the library itself is < 50KB compressed and obfuscated.

### Can I use the open-source Closure Library with angular?

Yes, you can use widgets from the {@link http://code.google.com/closure/library Closure Library}
in angular.

### Does angular use the jQuery library?

Yes, angular uses {@link http://jquery.com/ jQuery}, the open source DOM manipulation library.
If jQuery is not present in your script path, angular falls back on its own implementation of
{@link angular.element jQuery lite}. If jQuery is present in the path, angular uses it to
manipulate the DOM.

### What is testability like in angular?

Very testable. It has an integrated dependency injection framework. See
{@link angular.service service} for details.

### How can I learn more about angular?

Watch the July 28, 2010 talk
"{@link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elvcgVSynRg| Angular: A Radically Different Way of Building AJAX Apps}".

### How is angular licensed?

The MIT License.
