A great way to get introduced to angular is to work through the {@link tutorial.step_00 angular
tutorial}, which walks you through the construction of an angular web app. The app you will build
in the tutorial is loosely based on the {@link http://www.google.com/phone/ Google phone gallery
app}. The {@link http://angular.github.com/angular-phonecat/step-11/app/#/phones end result of our
effort} is visually simpler, but demonstrates many of the angular features without distractions in
the form of CSS code.

The starting point for our tutorial is the {@link https://github.com/angular/angular-seed
angular-seed project}.

The angular-seed project includes a simple example app, the latest angular libraries, test
libraries, and scripts. It provides all of these in an environment that is pre-configured for
developing a typical web app. For this tutorial, we modified the angular-seed as follows:

* Removed the example app
* Added phone images to `app/img/phones`
* Added phone data files (JSON) to `app/phones` 

**Note**: Using the angular seed app isn't required for building angular apps, but doing so helps
you get started quickly and makes the development and testing process much easier. 

When you finish the tutorial you will be able to:

* Create a simple dynamic application that works in any browser
* Define the differences between angular and common JavaScript frameworks
* Understand how data binding works in angular
* Use the angular-seed project to quickly boot-strap your own projects
* Create and run tests
* Identify resources for learning more about angular

Mac and Linux users can work through the tutorial, run tests, and experiment with the code using
Git or the snapshots described below. Windows users will be able follow the tutorial and read
through the source code and view the application running on our servers at different stages.

You can go through the whole tutorial in a couple of hours or you may want to spend a pleasant day
really digging into it. In any case, we promise that your time will be well spent!

# Prerequisites

To run the tutorial app and tests on your machine you will need the following:

* A Mac or Linux machine (required by the tutorial scripts, not angular)
* An http server running on your system. If you don't already have one installed, you can install
`node.js` ({@link https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation node.js install guide}) or
another http sever (such as Apache, etc.).
* Java. This is required for running tests with JsTestDriver.
* A web browser.
* A text editor.


# Working with the code

There are two ways that you can you follow this tutorial and hack on the code:

## Using Git

The following instructions are for developers who are comfortable with the Git versioning system:

1. Check to be sure you have all of the <a href="#PreReqs">prerequisites</a> on your system.

2. Clone the angular-phonecat repository located at {@link
https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat GitHub} by running the following command in a terminal:

        git clone git://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat.git

   This will create a directory called `angular-phonecat` in the current directory. 

3. Change your current directory to `angular-phonecat`. 

        cd angular-phonecat  

    The tutorial instructions assume you are running all commands from this directory.


## Using Snapshots

Snapshots are the sets of files that reflect the state of the tutorial app at each step. These
files include the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the app, plus Jasmine JavaScript files and Java
libraries for the test stack. These will let you run the tutorial app and tests, without requiring
knowledge of Git.  You can download and install the snapshot files as follows:

1. Check to be sure you have all of the <a href="#PreReqs">prerequisites</a> on your system.

2. {@link TODO Download the zip archive} with all files and unzip them into `[tutorial-dir]`
directory.


3. Change directories to `[tutorial-dir]/sandbox`.

        cd [tutorial-dir]/sandbox


# Tutorial Navigation

To see the app running on the angular server, click the "Live Demo" link at the top or bottom of
any tutorial page. To view the code differences between tutorial steps, click the Code Diff link
at top or bottom of each tutorial page. In the Code Diff, additions are highlighted in green;
deletions are highlighted in red.


Let's get going and proceed to {@link tutorial/step_00 step 0}.
