<ul doc-tutorial-nav="7"></ul>


In this step, you will learn how to create a layout template and how to build an app that has
multiple views by adding routing.


<div doc-tutorial-reset="7"></div>


Note that when you now navigate to `app/index.html`, you are redirected to `app/index.html#/phones`
and the same phone list appears in the browser. When you click on a phone link the stub of a phone
detail page is displayed.


The most important changes are listed below. You can see the full diff on [GitHub](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat/compare/step-6...step-7).


## Multiple Views, Routing and Layout Template

Our app is slowly growing and becoming more complex. Before step 7, the app provided our users with
a single view (the list of all phones), and all of the template code was located in the
`index.html` file. The next step in building the app is to add a view that will show detailed
information about each of the devices in our list.

To add the detailed view, we could expand the `index.html` file to contain template code for both
views, but that would get messy very quickly. Instead, we are going to turn the `index.html`
template into what we call a "layout template". This is a template that is common for all views in
our application. Other "partial templates" are then included into this layout template depending on
the current "route" — the view that is currently displayed to the user.

Application routes in Angular are declared via the
{@link ngRoute.$routeProvider $routeProvider}, which is the provider of the
{@link ngRoute.$route $route service}. This service makes it easy to wire together
controllers, view templates, and the current
URL location in the browser. Using this feature we can implement [deep linking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_linking), which lets us utilize the browser's
history (back and forward navigation) and bookmarks.


### A Note About DI, Injector and Providers

As you {@link tutorial/step_05 noticed}, {@link guide/di dependency injection} (DI) is at the core of
AngularJS, so it's important for you to understand a thing or two about how it works.

When the application bootstraps, Angular creates an injector that will be used for all DI stuff in
this app. The injector itself doesn't know anything about what `$http` or `$route` services do, in
fact it doesn't even know about the existence of these services unless it is configured with proper
module definitions. The sole responsibilities of the injector are to load specified module
definition(s), register all service providers defined in these modules, and when asked, inject
a specified function with dependencies (services) that it lazily instantiates via their providers.

Providers are objects that provide (create) instances of services and expose configuration APIs
that can be used to control the creation and runtime behavior of a service. In case of the `$route`
service, the `$routeProvider` exposes APIs that allow you to define routes for your application.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
**Note:** Providers can only be injected into `config` functions. Thus you could not inject
`$routeProvider` into `PhoneListCtrl`.
</div>

Angular modules solve the problem of removing global state from the application and provide a way
of configuring the injector. As opposed to AMD or require.js modules, Angular modules don't try to
solve the problem of script load ordering or lazy script fetching. These goals are totally independent and
both module systems can live side by side and fulfil their goals.

## The App Module

__`app/js/app.js`:__

```js
var phonecatApp = angular.module('phonecatApp', [
  'ngRoute',
  'phonecatControllers'
]);

phonecatApp.config(['$routeProvider',
  function($routeProvider) {
    $routeProvider.
      when('/phones', {
        templateUrl: 'partials/phone-list.html',
        controller: 'PhoneListCtrl'
      }).
      when('/phones/:phoneId', {
        templateUrl: 'partials/phone-detail.html',
        controller: 'PhoneDetailCtrl'
      }).
      otherwise({
        redirectTo: '/phones'
      });
  }]);
```

In order to configure our application with routes, we need to create a module for our application.
We call this module `phonecatApp`. Notice the second argument passed to `angular.module`:
`['ngRoute', 'phonecatControllers']`. This array lists the modules that `phonecatApp` depends on.

Above, we added `angular-route.js` to `index.html`. That's not all we need to do to be able to use
it, however. We also have to add `ngRoute` as a dependency of our app. To improve the organization
of the app, we're going to move the controllers into their own file (as shown below), and call the
module `phonecatControllers`. By listing these two modules as dependencies of `phonecatApp`, we
can use the directives and services they provide.

Thus using the `config` API we request the `$routeProvider` to be injected into our config function
and use the {@link ngRoute.$routeProvider#when `$routeProvider.when`} API to define our routes.

Our application routes are defined as follows:

* The phone list view will be shown when the URL hash fragment is `/phones`. To construct this
view, Angular will use the `phone-list.html` template and the `PhoneListCtrl` controller.

* The phone details view will be shown when the URL hash fragment matches '/phone/:phoneId', where
`:phoneId` is a variable part of the URL. To construct the phone details view, Angular will use the
`phone-detail.html` template and the `PhoneDetailCtrl` controller.

We reused the `PhoneListCtrl` controller that we constructed in previous steps and we added a new,
empty `PhoneDetailCtrl` controller to the `app/js/controllers.js` file for the phone details view.

`$routeProvider.otherwise({redirectTo: '/phones'})` triggers a redirection to `/phones` when the browser
address doesn't match either of our routes.

Note the use of the `:phoneId` parameter in the second route declaration. The `$route` service uses
the route declaration — `'/phones/:phoneId'` — as a template that is matched against the current
URL. All variables defined with the `:` notation are extracted into the
{@link ngRoute.$routeParams `$routeParams`} object.


In order for our application to bootstrap with our newly created module we'll also need to specify
the module name as the value of the {@link ng.directive:ngApp ngApp}
directive:

__`app/index.html`:__

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en" ng-app="phonecatApp">
...
```


## Controllers

__`app/js/controllers.js`:__

```js
var phonecatControllers = angular.module('phonecatControllers', []);

phonecatControllers.controller('PhoneListCtrl', ['$scope', '$http',
  function ($scope, $http) {
    $http.get('phones/phones.json').success(function(data) {
      $scope.phones = data;
    });

    $scope.orderProp = 'age';
  }]);

phonecatControllers.controller('PhoneDetailCtrl', ['$scope', '$routeParams',
  function($scope, $routeParams) {
    $scope.phoneId = $routeParams.phoneId;
  }]);
```

Again, note that we created a new module called `phonecatControllers`. For small AngularJS applications,
it's common to create just one module for all of your controllers if there are just a few. For larger apps,
you will probably want to create separate modules for each major feature of your app.

Because our example app is relatively small, we'll add all of our controllers to this module.

## Template

The `$route` service is usually used in conjunction with the {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView
ngView} directive. The role of the `ngView` directive is to include the view template for the current
route into the layout template. This makes it a perfect fit for our `index.html` template.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Note:** Starting with AngularJS version 1.2, `ngRoute` is in its own module and must be loaded by loading
the `angular-route.js` file distributed with Angular. The easiest way to load the file is to add a `<script>`
tag to your `index.html` file as shown below.
</div>

__`app/index.html`:__

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en" ng-app="phonecatApp">
<head>
...
  <script src="lib/angular/angular.js"></script>
  <script src="lib/angular/angular-route.js"></script>
  <script src="js/app.js"></script>
  <script src="js/controllers.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

  <div ng-view></div>

</body>
</html>
```

Note that we removed most of the code in the `index.html` template and replaced it with a single
line containing a div with the `ng-view` attribute. The code that we removed was placed into the
`phone-list.html` template:

__`app/partials/phone-list.html`:__

```html
<div class="container-fluid">
  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span2">
      <!--Sidebar content-->

      Search: <input ng-model="query">
      Sort by:
      <select ng-model="orderProp">
        <option value="name">Alphabetical</option>
        <option value="age">Newest</option>
      </select>

    </div>
    <div class="span10">
      <!--Body content-->

      <ul class="phones">
        <li ng-repeat="phone in phones | filter:query | orderBy:orderProp" class="thumbnail">
          <a href="#/phones/{{phone.id}}" class="thumb"><img ng-src="{{phone.imageUrl}}"></a>
          <a href="#/phones/{{phone.id}}">{{phone.name}}</a>
          <p>{{phone.snippet}}</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

<div style="display:none">
TODO!
<img  class="diagram" src="img/tutorial/tutorial_07_final.png">
</div>

We also added a placeholder template for the phone details view:

__`app/partials/phone-detail.html`:__

```html
TBD: detail view for {{phoneId}}
```

Note how we are using `phoneId` model defined in the `PhoneDetailCtrl` controller.


## Test

To automatically verify that everything is wired properly, we wrote end-to-end tests that navigate
to various URLs and verify that the correct view was rendered.

```js
...
  it('should redirect index.html to index.html#/phones', function() {
    browser().navigateTo('app/index.html');
    expect(browser().location().url()).toBe('/phones');
  });
...

 describe('Phone detail view', function() {

    beforeEach(function() {
      browser().navigateTo('app/index.html#/phones/nexus-s');
    });


    it('should display placeholder page with phoneId', function() {
      expect(binding('phoneId')).toBe('nexus-s');
    });
 });
```


You can now rerun `./scripts/e2e-test.sh` or refresh the browser tab with the end-to-end test
runner to see the tests run, or you can see them running on [Angular's server](http://angular.github.com/angular-phonecat/step-7/test/e2e/runner.html).


# Experiments

* Try to add an `{{orderProp}}` binding to `index.html`, and you'll see that nothing happens even
when you are in the phone list view. This is because the `orderProp` model is visible only in the
scope managed by `PhoneListCtrl`, which is associated with the `<div ng-view>` element. If you add
the same binding into the `phone-list.html` template, the binding will work as expected.

<div style="display: none">
* In `PhoneCatCtrl`, create a new model called "`hero`" with `this.hero = 'Zoro'`. In
`PhoneListCtrl` let's shadow it with `this.hero = 'Batman'`, and in `PhoneDetailCtrl` we'll use
`this.hero = "Captain Proton"`. Then add the `<p>hero = {{hero}}</p>` to all three of our templates
(`index.html`, `phone-list.html`, and `phone-detail.html`). Open the app and you'll see scope
inheritance and model property shadowing do some wonders.
</div>


# Summary

With the routing set up and the phone list view implemented, we're ready to go to {@link step_08
step 8} to implement the phone details view.
