In this step, you will add a clickable phone image swapper to the phone details page.


<div doc-tutorial-reset="10"></div>


The phone details view displays one large image of the current phone and several smaller thumbnail
images. It would be great if we could replace the large image with any of the thumbnails just by
clicking on the desired thumbnail image. Let's have a look at how we can do this with Angular.

The most important changes are listed below. You can see the full diff on {@link
https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat/compare/step-9...step-10
GitHub}:


## Controller

__`app/js/controllers.js`:__
<pre>
...
function PhoneDetailCtrl($scope, $routeParams, $http) {
  $http.get('phones/' + $routeParams.phoneId + '.json').success(function(data) {
    $scope.phone = data;
    $scope.mainImageUrl = data.images[0];
  });

  $scope.setImage = function(imageUrl) {
    $scope.mainImageUrl = imageUrl;
  }
}

//PhoneDetailCtrl.$inject = ['$scope', '$routeParams', '$http'];
</pre>

In the `PhoneDetailCtrl` controller, we created the `mainImageUrl` model property and set its
default value to the first phone image URL.

We also created a `setImage` event handler function that will change the value of `mainImageUrl`.


## Template

__`app/partials/phone-detail.html`:__
<pre>
<img ng-src="{{mainImageUrl}}" class="phone">

...

<ul class="phone-thumbs">
  <li ng-repeat="img in phone.images">
    <img ng-src="{{img}}" ng-click="setImage(img)">
  </li>
</ul>
...
</pre>

We bound the `ngSrc` directive of the large image to the `mainImageUrl` property.

We also registered an {@link api/ng.directive:ngClick `ngClick`}
handler with thumbnail images. When a user clicks on one of the thumbnail images, the handler will
use the `setImage` event handler function to change the value of the `mainImageUrl` property to the
URL of the thumbnail image.

<div style="display: none">
TODO!
<img  class="diagram" src="img/tutorial/tutorial_10-11_final.png">
</div>

## Test

To verify this new feature, we added two end-to-end tests. One verifies that the main image is set
to the first phone image by default. The second test clicks on several thumbnail images and
verifies that the main image changed appropriately.

__`test/e2e/scenarios.js`:__
<pre>
...
  describe('Phone detail view', function() {

...

    it('should display the first phone image as the main phone image', function() {
      expect(element('img.phone').attr('src')).toBe('img/phones/nexus-s.0.jpg');
    });


    it('should swap main image if a thumbnail image is clicked on', function() {
      element('.phone-thumbs li:nth-child(3) img').click();
      expect(element('img.phone').attr('src')).toBe('img/phones/nexus-s.2.jpg');

      element('.phone-thumbs li:nth-child(1) img').click();
      expect(element('img.phone').attr('src')).toBe('img/phones/nexus-s.0.jpg');
    });
  });
});
</pre>

You can now rerun `./scripts/e2e-test.sh` or refresh the browser tab with the end-to-end test
runner to see the tests run, or you can see them running on {@link
http://angular.github.com/angular-phonecat/step-8/test/e2e/runner.html
Angular's server}.

# Experiments

* Let's add a new controller method to `PhoneDetailCtrl`:

          $scope.hello = function(name) {
              alert('Hello ' + (name || 'world') + '!');
          }

  and add:

          <button ng-click="hello('Elmo')">Hello</button>

  to the `phone-details.html` template.

<div style="display: none">
TODO!
  The controller methods are inherited between controllers/scopes, so you can use the same snippet
in the `phone-list.html` template as well.

* Move the `hello` method from `PhoneCatCtrl` to `PhoneListCtrl` and you'll see that the button
declared in `index.html` will stop working, while the one declared in the `phone-list.html`
template remains operational.
</div>


# Summary

With the phone image swapper in place, we're ready for {@link step_11 step 11} (the last step!) to
learn an even better way to fetch data.
