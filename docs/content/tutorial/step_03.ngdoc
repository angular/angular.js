<ul doc-tutorial-nav="3"></ul>


We did a lot of work in laying a foundation for the app in the last step, so now we'll do something
simple; we will add full text search (yes, it will be simple!). We will also write an end-to-end
test, because a good end-to-end test is a good friend. It stays with your app, keeps an eye on it,
and quickly detects regressions.

* The app now has a search box. Notice that the phone list on the page changes depending on what a
user types into the search box.

## Controller

We made no changes to the controller.


## Template

__`app/index.html`:__

```html
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-2">
        <!--Sidebar content-->

        Search: <input ng-model="query">

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-10">
        <!--Body content-->

        <ul class="phones">
          <li ng-repeat="phone in phones | filter:query">
            {{phone.name}}
            <p>{{phone.snippet}}</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
```

We added a standard HTML `<input>` tag and used Angular's
{@link ng.filter:filter filter} function to process the input for the
{@link ng.directive:ngRepeat ngRepeat} directive.

This lets a user enter search criteria and immediately see the effects of their search on the phone
list. This new code demonstrates the following:

* Data-binding: This is one of the core features in Angular. When the page loads, Angular binds the
name of the input box to a variable of the same name in the data model and keeps the two in sync.

  In this code, the data that a user types into the input box (named __`query`__) is immediately
available as a filter input in the list repeater (`phone in phones | filter:`__`query`__). When
changes to the data model cause the repeater's input to change, the repeater efficiently updates
the DOM to reflect the current state of the model.

<img  class="diagram" src="img/tutorial/tutorial_03.png">

* Use of the `filter` filter: The {@link ng.filter:filter filter} function uses the
`query` value to create a new array that contains only those records that match the `query`.

  `ngRepeat` automatically updates the view in response to the changing number of phones returned
by the `filter` filter. The process is completely transparent to the developer.

## Test

In Step 2, we learned how to write and run unit tests. Unit tests are perfect for testing
controllers and other components of our application written in JavaScript, but they can't easily
test DOM manipulation or the wiring of our application. For these, an end-to-end test is a much
better choice.

The search feature was fully implemented via templates and data-binding, so we'll write our first
end-to-end test, to verify that the feature works.

__`test/e2e/scenarios.js`:__

```js
describe('PhoneCat App', function() {

  describe('Phone list view', function() {

    beforeEach(function() {
      browser.get('app/index.html');
    });


    it('should filter the phone list as user types into the search box', function() {

      var phoneList = element.all(by.repeater('phone in phones'));
      var query = element(by.model('query'));

      expect(phoneList.count()).toBe(3);

      query.sendKeys('nexus');
      expect(phoneList.count()).toBe(1);

      query.clear();
      query.sendKeys('motorola');
      expect(phoneList.count()).toBe(2);
    });
  });
});
```

This test verifies that the search box and the repeater are correctly wired together. Notice how
easy it is to write end-to-end tests in Angular. Although this example is for a simple test, it
really is that easy to set up any functional, readable, end-to-end test.

### Running End to End Tests with Protractor
Even though the syntax of this test looks very much like our controller unit test written with
Jasmine, the end-to-end test uses APIs of [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor). Read
about the Protractor APIs at https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/api.md.

Much like Karma is the test runner for unit tests, we use Protractor to run end-to-end tests.
Try it with `npm run protractor`. End-to-end tests are slow, so unlike with unit tests, Protractor
will exit after the test run and will not automatically rerun the test suite on every file change.
To rerun the test suite, execute `npm run protractor` again.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  Note: You must ensure you've installed the protractor and updated webdriver prior to running the
  `npm run protractor`. You can do this by issuing `npm install` and `npm run update-webdriver` into
  your terminal.
</div>


# Experiments

### Display Current Query
Display the current value of the `query` model by adding a `{{query}}` binding into the
`index.html` template, and see how it changes when you type in the input box.

### Display Query in Title
Let's see how we can get the current value of the `query` model to appear in the HTML page title.

* Add the following end-to-end test into the `describe` block within `test/e2e/scenarios.js`:

  ```js
    it('should display the current filter value in the title bar', function() {

      expect(browser.getTitle()).toMatch(/Google Phone Gallery:\s*$/);

      element(by.model('query')).sendKeys('nexus');

      expect(browser.getTitle()).toMatch(/Google Phone Gallery: nexus$/);
    });
  ```

  Run protractor (`npm run protractor`) to see this test fail.


* You might think you could just add the `{{query}}` to the title tag element as follows:

        <title>Google Phone Gallery: {{query}}</title>

  However, when you reload the page, you won't see the expected result. This is because the "query"
  model lives in the scope, defined by the `ng-controller="PhoneListCtrl"` directive, on the body
  element:

          <body ng-controller="PhoneListCtrl">

  If you want to bind to the query model from the `<title>` element, you must __move__ the
  `ngController` declaration to the HTML element because it is the common parent of both the body
  and title elements:

          <html ng-app="phonecatApp" ng-controller="PhoneListCtrl">

  Be sure to __remove__ the `ng-controller` declaration from the body element.

* Re-run `npm run protractor` to see the test now pass.

* While using double curlies works fine within the title element, you might have noticed that
for a split second they are actually displayed to the user while the page is loading. A better
solution would be to use the {@link ng.directive:ngBind ngBind} or
{@link ng.directive:ngBindTemplate ngBindTemplate} directives, which are invisible to the user
while the page is loading:

        <title ng-bind-template="Google Phone Gallery: {{query}}">Google Phone Gallery</title>


# Summary

We have now added full text search and included a test to verify that search works! Now let's go on
to {@link step_04 step 4} to learn how to add sorting capability to the phone app.
