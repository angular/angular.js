@name Tutorial: 1 - Static Template
@description

<ul doc-tutorial-nav="1"></ul>


In order to illustrate how Angular enhances standard HTML, you will create a purely *static* HTML
page and then examine how we can turn this HTML code into a template that Angular will use to
dynamically display the same result with any set of data.

In this step you will add some basic information about two cell phones to an HTML page.


<div doc-tutorial-reset="1"></div>


The page now contains a list with information about two phones.

The most important changes are listed below. You can see the full diff on {@link
https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat/compare/step-0...step-1 GitHub}:

__`app/index.html`:__
<pre>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span>Nexus S</span>
      <p>
        Fast just got faster with Nexus S.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>Motorola XOOMâ„¢ with Wi-Fi</span>
      <p>
        The Next, Next Generation tablet.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</pre>


# Experiments

* Try adding more static HTML to `index.html`. For example:

          <p>Total number of phones: 2</p>


# Summary

This addition to your app uses static HTML to display the list. Now, let's go to {@link step_02
step 2} to learn how to use AngularJS to dynamically generate the same list.
