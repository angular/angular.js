<ul doc-tutorial-nav="9"></ul>


In this step, you will learn how to create a layout template and how to build an application that
has multiple views by adding routing, using an Angular module called {@link ngRoute ngRoute}.

* When you now navigate to `/index.html`, you are redirected to `/index.html#!/phones` and the phone
  list appears in the browser.
* When you click on a phone link, the URL changes to that specific phone and the stub of a phone
  detail page is displayed.

## Dependencies

The routing functionality added in this step is provided by Angular in the `ngRoute` module, which
is distributed separately from the core Angular framework.

Since we are using [Bower][bower] to install client-side dependencies, this step updates the
`bower.json` configuration file to include the new dependency:

<br />
**`bower.json`:**

```json
{
  "name": "angular-phonecat",
  "description": "A starter project for AngularJS",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "homepage": "https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat",
  "license": "MIT",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "angular": "1.5.x",
    "angular-mocks": "1.5.x",
    "angular-route": "1.5.x",
    "bootstrap": "3.3.x"
  }
}
```

The new dependency `"angular-route": "1.5.x"` tells bower to install a version of the angular-route
module that is compatible with version 1.5.x of Angular. We must tell bower to download and install
this dependency.

```
npm install
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
  **Note:** If you have bower installed globally, you can run `bower install`, but for this project
  we have preconfigured `npm install` to run bower for us.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  **Warning:** If a new version of Angular has been released since you last ran `npm install`, then
  you may have a problem with the `bower install` due to a conflict between the versions of
  angular.js that need to be installed. If you run into this issue, simply delete your
  `app/bower_components` directory and then run `npm install`.
</div>


## Multiple Views, Routing and Layout Templates

Our app is slowly growing and becoming more complex. Prior to this step, the app provided our users
with a single view (including the list of all phones), and all of the template code was located in
the `phone-list.template.html` file. The next step in building the application is to add a view that
will show detailed information about each of the devices in our list.

To add the detailed view, we are going to turn `index.html` into what we call a "layout template".
This is a template that is common for all views in our application. Other "partial templates" are
then included into this layout template depending on the current "route" â€” the view that is
currently displayed to the user.

Application routes in Angular are declared via the {@link ngRoute.$routeProvider $routeProvider},
which is the provider of the {@link ngRoute.$route $route} service. This service makes it easy to
wire together controllers, view templates, and the current URL location in the browser. Using this
feature, we can implement [deep linking][deep-linking], which lets us utilize the browser's history
(back and forward navigation) and bookmarks.

<div class="alert alert-success">
  <p>
    `ngRoute` lets us associate a controller and a template with a specific URL (or URL
    pattern). This is pretty close to what we did with `ngController` and `index.html` back in
    {@link step_02 step 2}.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since we have already learned that components allow us to combine controllers with templates in
    a modular, testable way, we are going to use components for routing as well.
    Each route will be associated with a component and that component will be in charge of providing
    the view template and the controller.
  </p>
</div>


### A Note about DI, Injector and Providers

As you {@link step_07 noticed}, {@link guide/di dependency injection} (DI) is at the core of
AngularJS, so it's important for you to understand a thing or two about how it works.

When the application bootstraps, Angular creates an injector that will be used to find and inject
all of the services that are required by your application. The injector itself doesn't know anything
about what the `$http` or `$route` services do. In fact, the injector doesn't even know about the
existence of these services, unless it is configured with proper module definitions.

The injector only carries out the following steps:

* Load the module definition(s) that you specify in your application.
* Register all Providers defined in these module definition(s).
* When asked to do so, lazily instantiate services and their dependencies, via their Providers, as
  parameters to an injectable function.

Providers are objects that provide (create) instances of services and expose configuration APIs,
that can be used to control the creation and runtime behavior of a service. In case of the `$route`
service, the `$routeProvider` exposes APIs that allow you to define routes for your application.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  **Note:** Providers can only be injected into `config` functions. Thus you could not inject
  `$routeProvider` into `PhoneListController` at runtime.
</div>

Angular modules solve the problem of removing global variables from the application and provide a
way of configuring the injector. As opposed to AMD or require.js modules, Angular modules don't try
to solve the problem of script load ordering or lazy script fetching. These goals are totally
independent and both module systems can live side-by-side and fulfill their goals.

To deepen your understanding on Angular's DI, see [Understanding Dependency Injection][wiki-di].


## Template

The `$route` service is usually used in conjunction with the {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView ngView}
directive. The role of the `ngView` directive is to include the view template for the current route
into the layout template. This makes it a perfect fit for our `index.html` template.

<br />
**`app/index.html`:**

```html
<head>
  ...
  <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
  <script src="bower_components/angular-route/angular-route.js"></script>
  <script src="app.module.js"></script>
  <script src="app.config.js"></script>
  ...
  <script src="phone-detail/phone-detail.module.js"></script>
  <script src="phone-detail/phone-detail.component.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

  <div ng-view></div>

</body>
```

We have added four new `<script>` tags in our `index.html` file to load some extra JavaScript files
into our application:

* `angular-route.js`: Defines the Angular `ngRoute` module, which provides us with routing.
* `app.config.js`: Configures the providers available to our main module (see
  [below](tutorial/step_09#configuring-a-module)).
* `phone-detail.module.js`: Defines a new module containing a `phoneDetail` component.
* `phone-detail.component.js`: Defines a dummy `phoneDetail` component (see
  [below](tutorial/step_09#the-phonedetail-component)).

Note that we removed the `<phone-list></phone-list>` line from the `index.html` template and
replaced it with a `<div>` with the `ng-view` attribute.

<img class="diagram" src="img/tutorial/tutorial_09.png">


## Configuring a Module

A module's {@link ng.angular.Module#config .config()} method gives us access to the available
providers for configuration. To make the providers, services and directives defined in `ngRoute`
available to our application, we need to add `ngRoute` as a dependency of our `phonecatApp` module.

<br />
**`app/app.module.js`:**

```js
angular.module('phonecatApp', [
  'ngRoute',
  ...
]);
```

Now, in addition to the core services and directives, we can also configure the `$route` service
(using it's provider) for our application. In order to be able to quickly locate the configuration
code, we put it into a separate file and used the `.config` suffix.

<br />
**`app/app.config.js`:**

```js
  angular.
    module('phonecatApp').
    config(['$locationProvider', '$routeProvider',
      function config($locationProvider, $routeProvider) {
        $locationProvider.hashPrefix('!');

        $routeProvider.
          when('/phones', {
            template: '<phone-list></phone-list>'
          }).
          when('/phones/:phoneId', {
            template: '<phone-detail></phone-detail>'
          }).
          otherwise('/phones');
      }
    ]);
```

Using the `.config()` method, we request the necessary providers (for example the `$routeProvider`)
to be injected into our configuration function and then use their methods to specify the behavior of
the corresponding services. Here, we use the
{@link ngRoute.$routeProvider#when $routeProvider.when()} and
{@link ngRoute.$routeProvider#otherwise $routeProvider.otherwise()} methods to define our
application routes.

<div class="alert alert-success">
  <p>
    We also used {@link $locationProvider#hashPrefix $locationProvider.hashPrefix()} to set the
    hash-prefix to `!`. This prefix will appear in the links to our client-side routes, right after
    the hash (`#`) symbol and before the actual path (e.g. `index.html#!/some/path`).
  </p>
  <p>
    Setting a prefix is not necessary, but it is considered a good practice (for reasons that are
    outside the scope of this tutorial). `!` is the most commonly used prefix.
  </p>
</div>

Our routes are defined as follows:

* `when('/phones')`: Determines the view that will be shown, when the URL hash fragment is
  `/phones`. According to the specified template, Angular will create an instance of the `phoneList`
  component to manage the view. Note that this is the same markup that we used to have in the
  `index.html` file.

* `when('/phones/:phoneId')`: Determines the view that will be shown, when the URL hash fragment
  matches `/phones/<phoneId>`, where `<phoneId>` is a variable part of the URL. In charge of the
  view will be the `phoneDetail` component.

* `otherwise('/phones')`: Defines a fallback route to redirect to, when no route definition matches
  the current URL.(Here it will redirect to `/phones`.)

We reused the `phoneList` component that we have already built and a new "dummy" `phoneDetail`
component. For now, the `phoneDetail` component will just display the selected phone's ID.
(Not too impressive, but we will enhance it in the {@link step_10 next step}.)

Note the use of the `:phoneId` parameter in the second route declaration. The `$route` service uses
the route declaration â€” `'/phones/:phoneId'` â€” as a template that is matched against the current
URL. All variables defined with the `:` prefix are extracted into the (injectable)
{@link ngRoute.$routeParams $routeParams} object.


## The `phoneDetail` Component

We created a `phoneDetail` component to handle the phone details view. We followed the same
conventions as with `phoneList`, using a separate directory and creating a `phoneDetail` module,
which we added as a dependency of the `phonecatApp` module.

<br />
**`app/phone-detail/phone-detail.module.js`:**

```js
angular.module('phoneDetail', [
  'ngRoute'
]);
```

<br />
**`app/phone-detail/phone-detail.component.js`:**

```js
  angular.
    module('phoneDetail').
    component('phoneDetail', {
      template: 'TBD: Detail view for <span>{{$ctrl.phoneId}}</span>',
      controller: ['$routeParams',
        function PhoneDetailController($routeParams) {
          this.phoneId = $routeParams.phoneId;
        }
      ]
    });
```

<br />
**`app/app.module.js`:**

```js
angular.module('phonecatApp', [
  ...
  'phoneDetail',
  ...
]);
```

### A Note on Sub-module Dependencies

The `phoneDetail` module depends on the `ngRoute` module for providing the `$routeParams` object,
which is used in the `phoneDetail` component's controller. Since `ngRoute` is also a dependency of
the main `phonecatApp` module, its services and directives are already available everywhere in the
application (including the `phoneDetail` component).

This means that our application would continue to work even if we didn't include `ngRoute` in the
list of dependencies for the `phoneDetail` component. Although it might be tempting to omit
dependencies of a sub-module that are already imported by the main module, it breaks our hard-earned
modularity.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  Imagine what would happen if we decided to copy the `phoneDetail` feature over to another project
  that does not declare a dependency on `ngRoute`. The injector would not be able to provide
  `$routeParams` and our application would break.
</div>

The takeaway here is:

* Always be explicit about the dependecies of a sub-module. Do not rely on dependencies inherited
  from a parent module (because that parent module might not be there some day).

<div class="alert alert-success">
  Declaring the same dependency in multiple modules does not incur extra "cost", because Angular
  will still load each dependency once. For more info on modules and their dependencies take a look
  at the [Modules](guide/module) section of the Developer Guide.
</div>


# Testing

Since some of our modules depend on {@link ngRoute ngRoute} now, it is necessary to update the Karma
configuration file with angular-route. Other than that, the unit tests should (still) pass without
any modification.

<br />
**`karma.conf.js`:**

```js
    files: [
      'bower_components/angular/angular.js',
      'bower_components/angular-route/angular-route.js',
      ...
    ],
```

<br />
To automatically verify that everything is wired properly, we wrote E2E tests for navigating to
various URLs and verifying that the correct view was rendered.

<br />
**`e2e-tests/scenarios.js`**

```js
  ...

  it('should redirect `index.html` to `index.html#!/phones', function() {
    browser.get('index.html');
    expect(browser.getLocationAbsUrl()).toBe('/phones');
  });

  ...

  describe('View: Phone list', function() {

    beforeEach(function() {
      browser.get('index.html#!/phones');
    });

    ...

  });

  ...

  describe('View: Phone details', function() {

    beforeEach(function() {
      browser.get('index.html#!/phones/nexus-s');
    });

    it('should display placeholder page with `phoneId`', function() {
      expect(element(by.binding('$ctrl.phoneId')).getText()).toBe('nexus-s');
    });

  });

  ...
```

You can now rerun `npm run protractor` to see the tests run (and hopefully pass).


# Experiments

<div></div>

* Try to add a `{{$ctrl.phoneId}` binding in the template string for the phone details view:

  ```js
  when('/phones/:phoneId', {
    template: '{{$ctrl.phoneId}} <phone-detail></phone-detail>'
  ...
  ```

  You will see that nothing happens, even when you are in the phone details view. This is because
  the `phoneId` model is visible only in the context set by the `phoneDetail` component. Again,
  component isolation at work!


# Summary

With the routing set up and the phone list view implemented, we are ready to go to
{@link step_10 step 10} and implement a proper phone details view.
