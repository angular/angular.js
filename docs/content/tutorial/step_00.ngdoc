You are now ready to build the AngularJS phonecat app. In this step, you will become familiar
with the most important source code files, learn how to start the development servers bundled with
angular-seed, and run the application in the browser.

You can now see the page in your browser. It's not very exciting, but that's OK.

The HTML page that displays "Nothing here yet!" was constructed with the HTML code shown below.
The code contains some key Angular elements that we will need going forward.

__`app/index.html`:__
<pre>
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en" ng-app>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>My HTML File</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/app.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap.css">
  <script src="lib/angular/angular.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

  <p>Nothing here {{'yet' + '!'}}</p>

</body>
</html>
</pre>



## What is the code doing?

* `ng-app` directive:

          <html ng-app>

  The `ng-app` attribute represents an Angular directive (named `ngApp`; Angular uses
  `name-with-dashes` for attribute names and `camelCase` for the corresponding directive name)
  used to flag an element which Angular should consider to be the root element of our application.
  This gives application developers the freedom to tell Angular if the entire html page or only a
  portion of it should be treated as the Angular application.

* AngularJS script tag:

          <script src="lib/angular/angular.js">

  This code downloads the `angular.js` script and registers a callback that will be executed by the
browser when the containing HTML page is fully downloaded. When the callback is executed, Angular
looks for the {@link api/ng.directive:ngApp ngApp} directive. If
Angular finds the directive, it will bootstrap the application with the root of the application DOM
being the element on which the `ngApp` directive was defined.

* Double-curly binding with an expression:

          Nothing here {{'yet' + '!'}}

  This line demonstrates the core feature of Angular's templating capabilities â€“ a binding, denoted
  by double-curlies `{{ }}` as well as a simple expression `'yet' + '!'` used in this binding.

  The binding tells Angular that it should evaluate an expression and insert the result into the
  DOM in place of the binding. Rather than a one-time insert, as we'll see in the next steps, a
  binding will result in efficient continuous updates whenever the result of the expression
  evaluation changes.

  {@link guide/expression Angular expression} is a JavaScript-like code snippet that is
  evaluated by Angular in the context of the current model scope, rather than within the scope of
  the global context (`window`).

  As expected, once this template is processed by Angular, the html page contains the text:
  "Nothing here yet!".

## Bootstrapping AngularJS apps

Bootstrapping AngularJS apps automatically using the `ngApp` directive is very easy and suitable
for most cases. In advanced cases, such as when using script loaders, you can use
{@link guide/bootstrap imperative / manual way} to bootstrap the app.

There are 3 important things that happen during the app bootstrap:

1. The {@link api/AUTO.$injector injector} that will be used for dependency injection
   within this app is created.

2. The injector will then create the {@link api/ng.$rootScope root scope} that will
   become the context for the model of our application.

3. Angular will then "compile" the DOM starting at the `ngApp` root element, processing any
   directives and bindings found along the way.


Once an application is bootstrapped, it will then wait for incoming browser events (such as mouse
click, key press or incoming HTTP response) that might change the model. Once such an event occurs,
Angular detects if it caused any model changes and if changes are found, Angular will reflect them
in the view by updating all of the affected bindings.

The structure of our application is currently very simple. The template contains just one directive
and one static binding, and our model is empty. That will soon change!

## What are all these files in my working directory?

Most of the files in your working directory come from the {@link
https://github.com/angular/angular-seed angular-seed project} which is typically used to bootstrap
new Angular projects. The seed project includes the latest Angular libraries, test libraries,
scripts and a simple example app, all pre-configured for developing a typical web app.

For the purposes of this tutorial, we modified the angular-seed with the following changes:

* Removed the example app
* Added phone images to `app/img/phones/`
* Added phone data files (JSON) to `app/phones/`
* Added [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) files to `app/css/` and `app/img/`



# Experiments

* Try adding a new expression to the `index.html` that will do some math:

          <p>1 + 2 = {{ 1 + 2 }}</p>



# Summary

Now let's go to {@link step_01 step 1} and add some content to the web app.


<ul doc-tutorial-nav="0"></ul>

<div style="display: none">
Note: During the bootstrap the injector and the root scope will then be associated with the
   element on which the `ngApp` directive was declared, so when debugging the app you can retrieve
   them from browser console via `angular.element(rootElement).scope()` and
   `angular.element(rootElement).injector()`.
