In this step, you will add thumbnail images for the phones in the phone list, and links that, for
now, will go nowhere. In subsequent steps you will use the links to display additional information
about the phones in the catalog.


1. Reset your workspace to step 6.


         git checkout -f step-6


  or


         ./goto_step.sh 6


2. Refresh your browser or check the app out on {@link
http://angular.github.com/angular-phonecat/step-6/app angular's server}.

You should now see links and images of the phones in the list.


The most important changes are listed below. You can see the full diff on {@link

GitHub}:




## Data


Note that the `phones.json` file contains unique ids and image urls for each of the phones. The
urls point to the `app/img/phones/` directory.


__`app/phones/phones.json`__ (sample snippet):
<pre>
 [
  {
   ...
   "id": "motorola-defy-with-motoblur",
   "imageUrl": "img/phones/motorola-defy-with-motoblur.0.jpg",
   "name": "Motorola DEFY\u2122 with MOTOBLUR\u2122",
   ...
  },
 ...
 ]
</pre>




## Template


__`app/index.html`:__
<pre>
...
  <ul class="phones">
    <li ng:repeat="phone in phones.$filter(query).$orderBy(orderProp)">
      <a href="#/phones/{{phone.id}}">{{phone.name}}</a>
      <a href="#/phones/{{phone.id}}" class="thumb"><img ng:src="{{phone.imageUrl}}"></a>
      <p>{{phone.snippet}}</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
...
</pre>


To dynamically generate links that will in the future lead to phone detail pages, we used the
now-familiar {@link angular.markup double-curly brace markup} in the `href` attribute values. In
step 2, we added the `{{phone.name}}` binding as the element content. In this step the
'{{phone.id}}' binding is used in the element attribute.


We also added phone images next to each record using an image tag with the {@link
angular.directive.ng:src ng:src} directive. That directive prevents the browser from treating the
angular `{{ exppression }}` markup literally, which it would have done if we had only specified an
attribute binding in a regular `src` attribute (`<img src="{{phone.imageUrl}}">`). Using `ng:src`
prevents the browser from making an http request to an invalid location.




## Test


__`test/e2e/scenarios.js`__:
<pre>
...
    it('should render phone specific links', function() {
      input('query').enter('nexus');
      element('.phones li a').click();
      expect(browser().location().hash()).toBe('/phones/nexus-s');
    });
...
</pre>


We added a new end-to-end test to verify that the app is generating correct links to the phone
views that we will implement in the upcoming steps.


You can now refresh the browser tab with the end-to-end test runner to see the tests run, or you
can see them running on {@link
http://angular.github.com/angular-phonecat/step-6/test/e2e/runner.html
angular's server}.


# Experiments


* Replace the `ng:src` directive with a plain old `<src>` attribute. Using tools such as Firebug,
or Chrome's Web Inspector, or inspecting the webserver access logs, confirm that the app is indeed
making an extraneous request to `/app/%7B%7Bphone.imageUrl%7D%7D` (or
`/app/index.html/{{phone.imageUrl}}`).




# Summary


Now that you have added phone images and links, go to step 7 to learn about angular layout
templates and how angular makes it easy to create applications that have multiple views.
