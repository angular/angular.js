### Long Term Support

On July 1st 2018, we will enter a Long Term Support period for AngularJS.

At this time we will focus exclusively on providing fixes to bugs that satisfy at least one of the following criteria:

* A security flaw is detected in the 1.7.x branch of the framework
* One of the major browsers releases a version that will cause current production applications using AngularJS 1.7.x to stop working
* The jQuery library releases a version that will cause current production applications using AngularJS 1.7.x to stop working.
