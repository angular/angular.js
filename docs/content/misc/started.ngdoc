# Getting Started

We want you to have an easy time while starting to use Angular.  We've put together the following steps on your path to
becoming an Angular expert.

1. Read the {@link guide/concepts conceptual overview}.<br/>Understand Angular's vocabulary and how all the Angular
   components work together.
1. Do the {@link tutorial/ AngularJS Tutorial}.<br/>Walk end-to-end through building an application complete with tests
   on top of a node.js web server.  Covers every major AngularJS feature and shows you how to set up your development
   environment.
1. Download or clone the [Seed App project template](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed).<br/>Gives you a
   starter app with a directory layout, test harness, and scripts to begin building your application.
