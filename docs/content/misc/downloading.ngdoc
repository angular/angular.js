# Including angular scripts from the Google CDN
The quickest way to get started is to point your html `<script>` tag to a Google CDN URL.
This way, you don't have to download anything or maintain a local copy.

There are two types of angular script URLs you can point to, one for development and one for
production:

* __angular-<version>.js__ — This is the human-readable, non-minified version, suitable for web
development.
* __angular-<version>.min.js__ — This is the minified version, which we strongly suggest you use in
production.

To point your code to an angular script on the Google CDN server, use the following template.  This
example points to the minified version 1.0.2:

<pre>
  <!doctype html>
  <html ng-app>
    <head>
      <title>My Angular App</title>
      <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.0.2/angular.min.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
  </html>
</pre>

Note that only versions 1.0.1 and above are available on the CDN, if you need an earlier version
you can use the <http://code.angularjs.org/> URL which was the previous recommended location for
hosted code source. If you're still using the angular server you should switch to the CDN version
for even faster loading times.

# Downloading and hosting angular files locally
This option is for those who want to work with angular offline, or those who want to host the
angular files on their own servers.

If you navigate to <http://code.angularjs.org/>, you'll see a directory listing with all of the
angular versions since we started releasing versioned build artifacts (quite late in the project
lifetime).  Each directory contains all artifacts that we released for a particular version.
Download the version you want and have fun.

Each directory under <http://code.angularjs.org/> includes the following set of files:

* __`angular.js`__ — This file is non-obfuscated, non-minified, and human-readable by
opening it it any editor or browser. In order to get better error messages during development, you
should always use this non-minified angular script.

* __`angular.min.js`__ — This is a minified and obfuscated version of
`angular.js` created with the Closure compiler. Use this version for production in order
to minimize the size of the application that is downloaded by your user's browser.

* __`angular.zip`__ — This is a zip archive that contains all of the files released
for this angular version. Use this file to get everything in a single download.

* __`angular-mocks.js`__ — This file contains an implementation of mocks that makes
testing angular apps even easier. Your unit/integration test harness should load this file after
`angular-<version>.js` is loaded.

* __`angular-scenario.js`__ — This file is a very nifty JavaScript file that allows you
to write and execute end-to-end tests for angular applications.

* __`angular-loader.min.js`__ — Module loader for Angular modules. If you are loading multiple script files containing
 Angular modules, you can load them asynchronosuly and in any order as long as you load this file first. Often the
 contents of this file are copy&pasted into the `index.html` to avoid even the inial request to `angular-loader.min.js`.
 See [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed/blob/master/app/index-async.html) for an example of usage.

* __`angular-resource.js`__, __`angular-cookies.js`__, etc - extra Angular modules with additional functionality.

* __`docs`__ — this directory contains all the files that compose the
<http://docs.angularjs.org/> documentation app. These files are handy to see the older version of
our docs, or even more importantly, view the docs offline.
