# AngularJS API Docs
Welcome to the AngularJS API docs page. These pages contain the AngularJS reference materials for version <strong ng-bind="version"></strong>.

The documentation is organized into **modules** which contain various components of an AngularJS application.
These components are directives, services, filters, providers, types, global APIs and testing mocks.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Angular Namespaces `$` and `$$`**

To prevent accidental name collisions with your code,
Angular prefixes names of public objects with `$` and names of private objects with `$$`.
Please do not use the `$` or `$$` prefix in your code.

## Angular Namespace


## {@link ng ng (core module)}
This module is provided by default and contains the core components of AngularJS.

<table class="definition-table spaced">
  <tr>
    <td>{@link ng#directive Directives}</td>
    <td>
      <p>
        This is the core collection of directives you would use in your template code to build an AngularJS application.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some examples include:
          {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick},
          {@link ng.directive:ngInclude ngInclude},
          {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat ngRepeat},
          etc… <br />
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      {@link ng#service Services / Factories}
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>
        This is the core collection of services which are used within the DI of your application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some examples include:
          {@link ng.$compile $compile},
          {@link ng.$http $http},
          {@link ngRoute.$routeParams $routeParams},

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      {@link ng#filter Filters}
    </td>

        Some examples include:
          {@link ng.filter:filter filter},
