@name Developer Guide: About MVC in Angular: Understanding the View Component
@description

In Angular, the view is the DOM loaded and rendered in the browser, after Angular has transformed
the DOM based on information in the template, controller and model.

In the Angular implementation of MVC, the view has knowledge of both the model and the controller.
The view knows about the model where two-way data-binding occurs. The view has knowledge of the
controller through Angular directives, such as {@link api/ng.directive:ngController
ngController} and {@link api/ng.directive:ngView ngView}, and through bindings of this form:
`{{someControllerFunction()}}`. In these ways, the view can call functions in an associated
controller function.
