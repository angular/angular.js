@name Developer Guide: About MVC in Angular
@description

While Model-View-Controller (MVC) has acquired different shades of meaning over the years since it
first appeared, Angular incorporates the basic principles behind the original {@link
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller MVC} software design pattern into its way of
building client-side web applications.

The MVC pattern summarized:

* Separate applications into distinct presentation, data, and logic components
* Encourage loose coupling between these components

Along with {@link dev_guide.services services} and {@link di dependency injection}, MVC
makes angular applications better structured, easier to maintain and more testable.

The following topics explain how angular incorporates the MVC pattern into the angular way of
developing web applications:

* {@link dev_guide.mvc.understanding_model Understanding the Model Component}
* {@link dev_guide.mvc.understanding_controller Understanding the Controller Component}
* {@link dev_guide.mvc.understanding_view Understanding the View Component}
