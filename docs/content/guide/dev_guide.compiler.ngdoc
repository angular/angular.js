@name Developer Guide: Angular HTML Compiler
@description

The core of Angular is its HTML compiler.  The compiler processes Angular 
{@link guide/directive directives} allowing them to transform a
static HTML page into a dynamic web application.

The default HTML transformations that the Angular compiler provides are useful for building generic
apps, but you can also extend the compiler to create a domain-specific language for building
specific types of web applications.

All compilation takes place in the web browser; no server is involved.
