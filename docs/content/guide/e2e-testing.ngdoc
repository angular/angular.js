# E2E Testing

<div class="alert alert-danger">
**Note:** In the past, end-to-end testing could be done with a deprecated tool called
[AngularJS Scenario Runner](http://code.angularjs.org/1.2.16/docs/guide/e2e-testing). That tool
is now in maintenance mode.

As applications grow in size and complexity, it becomes unrealistic to rely on manual testing to
verify the correctness of new features, catch bugs and notice regressions. Unit tests
are the first line of defense for catching bugs, but sometimes issues come up with integration
between components which can't be captured in a unit test. End-to-end tests are made to find
these problems.

We have built [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor), an end
to end test runner which simulates user interactions that will help you verify the health of your
AngularJS application.

## Using Protractor

Protractor is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) program, and runs end-to-end tests that are also
written in JavaScript and run with node. Protractor uses [WebDriver](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/GettingStarted)
to control browsers and simulate user actions.

For more information on Protractor, view [getting started](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/getting-started)
or the [api docs](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/api).

Protractor uses [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/1.3/introduction.html) for its test syntax.
As in unit testing, a test file is comprised of one or
more `it` blocks that describe the requirements of your application. `it` blocks are made of
**commands** and **expectations**. Commands tell Protractor to do something with the application
such as navigate to a page or click on a button. Expectations tell Protractor to assert something
about the application's state, such as the value of a field or the current URL.

If any expectation within an `it` block fails, the runner marks the `it` as "failed" and continues
on to the next block.

Test files may also have `beforeEach` and `afterEach` blocks, which will be run before or after
each `it` block regardless of whether the block passes or fails.

In addition to the above elements, tests may also contain helper functions to avoid duplicating
code in the `it` blocks.

Here is an example of a simple test:
```js
describe('TODO list', function() {
  it('should filter results', function() {

    // Find the element with ng-model="user" and type "jacksparrow" into it
    element(by.model('user')).sendKeys('jacksparrow');

    // Find the first (and only) button on the page and click it
    element(by.css(':button')).click();

    // Verify that there are 10 tasks
    expect(element.all(by.repeater('task in tasks')).count()).toEqual(10);

    // Enter 'groceries' into the element with ng-model="filterText"
    element(by.model('filterText')).sendKeys('groceries');

    // Verify that now there is only one item in the task list
    expect(element.all(by.repeater('task in tasks')).count()).toEqual(1);
  });
});
```

This test describes the requirements of a ToDo list, specifically, that it should be able to
filter the list of items.

## Example
See the [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) project for more examples, or look
at the embedded examples in the AngularJS documentation (For example, {@link $http $http}
has an end-to-end test in the example under the `protractor.js` tag).

## Caveats

Protractor does not work out-of-the-box with apps that bootstrap manually using
`angular.bootstrap`. You must use the `ng-app` directive.
