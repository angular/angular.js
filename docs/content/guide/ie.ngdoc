# Internet Explorer Compatibility

<div class="alert alert-warning">
**Note:** AngularJS 1.3 has dropped support for IE8. Read more about it on
[our blog](http://blog.angularjs.org/2013/12/angularjs-13-new-release-approaches.html).
AngularJS 1.2 will continue to support IE8, but the core team does not plan to spend time
addressing issues specific to IE8 or earlier.

This document describes the Internet Explorer (IE) idiosyncrasies when dealing with custom HTML
attributes and tags. Read this document if you are planning on deploying your Angular application
on IE.

The project currently supports and will attempt to fix bugs for IE9 and above. The continuous
integration server runs all the tests against IE9, IE10, and IE11. See
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/angular/angular.js) and
[ci.angularjs.org](http://ci.angularjs.org).

We do not run tests on IE8 and below. A subset of the AngularJS functionality may work on these
browsers, but it is up to you to test and decide whether it works for your particular app.


To ensure your Angular application works on IE please consider:

1. Use `ng-style` tags instead of `style="{{ someCss }}"`. The latter works in Chrome and Firefox
   but does not work in Internet Explorer <= 11 (the most recent version at time of writing).
2. For the `type` attribute of buttons, use `ng-attr-type` tags instead of 
   `type="{{ someExpression }}"`.  If using the latter, Internet Explorer overwrites the expression
   with `type="submit"` before Angular has a chance to interpolate it.
