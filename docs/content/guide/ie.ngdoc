# Overview

This document describes the Internet Explorer (IE) idiosyncrasies when dealing with custom HTML
attributes and tags. Read this document if you are planning on deploying your angular application
on IE v8.0 or earlier.

# Short Version

To make your angular application work on IE please make sure that:

  1.  You provide JSON.stringify (via
  [Douglas Crockford's JSON2 library](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js), or similar)
  if the browser does not have it. IE7 and earlier will need this.

  2. you **do not** use custom element tags such as `<ng:view>` (use the attribute version `<div
  ng-view>` instead), or

  3. if you **do use** custom element tags, then you must take these steps to make IE happy:

<pre>
  <html xmlns:ng="http://angularjs.org">
    <head>
      <!--[if lte IE 8]>
        <script>
          document.createElement('ng-include');
          document.createElement('ng-pluralize');
          document.createElement('ng-view');
          
          // Optionally these for CSS
          document.createElement('ng:include');
          document.createElement('ng:pluralize');
          document.createElement('ng:view');
        </script>
      <![endif]-->
    </head>
    <body>
      ...
    </body>
  </html>
</pre>

The **important** parts are:

  * `xmlns:ng` - *namespace* - you need one namespace for each custom tag you are planning on
    using.

  * `document.createElement(yourTagName)` - *creation of custom tag names* - Since this is an
    issue only for older version of IE you need to load it conditionally. For each tag which does
    not have namespace and which is not defined in HTML you need to pre-declare it to make IE
    happy.


# Long Version

IE has an issues with element tag names which are not standard HTML tag names. These fall into two
categories, and each category has its own fix.

  * If the tag name starts with `my:` prefix than it is considered an XML namespace and must
    have corresponding namespace declaration on `<html xmlns:my="ignored">`

  * If the tag has no `:` but it is not a standard HTML tag, then it must be pre-created using
    `document.createElement('my-tag')`

  * If you have are planning on styling the custom tag with CSS selectors, then it must be
    pre-created using `document.createElement('my-tag')` regardless of XML namespace.


## The Good News

The good news is that these restrictions only apply to element tag names, and not to element 
attribute names. So this requires no special handling in IE: `<div my-tag your:tag></div>`.


## What happens if I fail to do this?

Suppose you have HTML with unknown tag `mytag` (this could also be `my:tag` or `my-tag` with same
result):

<pre>
  <html>
    <body>
      <mytag>some text</mytag>
    </body>
  </html>
</pre>

It should pares into the following DOM:

<pre>
#document
  +- HTML
     +- BODY
        +- mytag
           +- #text: some text
</pre>

The expected behavior is that the `BODY` element has a child element `mytag`, which in turn has
the text `some text`.

But this is not what IE does (if the above fixes are not included):

<pre>
#document
  +- HTML
     +- BODY
        +- mytag
        +- #text: some text
        +- /mytag
</pre>

In IE, the behavior is that the `BODY` element has three children:

  1. A self closing `mytag`. Example of self closing tag is `<br/>`. The trailing `/` is optional,
  but the `<br>` tag is not allowed to have any children, and browsers consider `<br>some
  text</br>` as three siblings not a `<br>` with `some text` as child.

  2. A text node with `some text`. This should have been a child of `mytag` above, not a sibling.

  3. A corrupt self closing `/mytag`. This is corrupt since element names are not allowed to have
  the `/` character. Furthermore this closing element should not be part of the DOM since it is
  only used to delimitate the structure of the DOM.


## CSS Styling of Custom Tag Names

The to make CSS selector work with custom elements the custom element name must be shived with the
`document.createElement('my-tag')` regardless of XML namespace.

<pre>
  <html xmlns:ng="needed for ng: namespace">
    <head>
      <!--[if lte IE 8]>
        <script>
          // needed to make ng-include parse properly
          document.createElement('ng-include');
          
          // needed to enable CSS reference
          document.createElement('ng:view');
        </script>
      <![endif]-->
      <style>
        ng\\:view {
          display: block;
          border: 1px solid red;
        }

        ng-include {
          display: block;
          border: 1px solid blue;
        }
      </style>
    </head>
    <body>
      <ng:view></ng:view>
      <ng-include></ng-include>
      ...
    </body>
  </html>
</pre>
