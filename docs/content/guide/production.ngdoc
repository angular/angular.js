# Running an AngularJS App in Production

There are a few things you might consider when running your AngularJS application in production.


## Disabling Debug Data

By default AngularJS attaches information about binding and scopes to DOM nodes,
and adds CSS classes to data-bound elements:

- As a result of `ngBind`, `ngBindHtml` or `{{...}}` interpolations, binding data and CSS class
`ng-binding` are attached to the corresponding element.

- Where the compiler has created a new scope, the scope and either `ng-scope` or `ng-isolated-scope`
CSS class are attached to the corresponding element. These scope references can then be accessed via
`element.scope()` and `element.isolateScope()`.

- Placeholder comments for structural directives will contain information about what directive
and binding caused the placeholder. E.g. `<!-- ngIf: shouldShow() -->`.

Tools like [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor) and
[Batarang](https://github.com/angular/angularjs-batarang) need this information to run,
but you can disable this in production for a significant performance boost with:

```js
myApp.config(['$compileProvider', function ($compileProvider) {
  $compileProvider.debugInfoEnabled(false);
}]);
```

If you wish to debug an application with this information then you should open up a debug
console in the browser then call this method directly in this console:

```js
angular.reloadWithDebugInfo();
```

The page should reload and the debug information should now be available.

For more see the docs pages on {@link ng.$compileProvider#debugInfoEnabled `$compileProvider`}
and {@link angular.reloadWithDebugInfo `angular.reloadWithDebugInfo`}.

## Strict DI Mode

Using strict di mode in your production application will throw errors when an injectable
function is not
{@link di#dependency-annotation annotated explicitly}. Strict di mode is intended to help
you make sure that your code will work when minified. However, it also will force you to
make sure that your injectable functions are explicitly annotated which will improve
angular's performance when injecting dependencies in your injectable functions because it
doesn't have to dynamically discover a function's dependencies. It is recommended to
automate the explicit annotation via a tool like
[ng-annotate](https://github.com/olov/ng-annotate) when you deploy to production (and enable
strict di mode)

To enable strict di mode, you have two options:

```html
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-strict-di>
  <!-- your app here -->
</div>
```

or

```js
angular.bootstrap(document, ['myApp'], {
  strictDi: true
});
```

For more information, see the
{@link di#using-strict-dependency-injection DI Guide}.


## Disable comment and css class directives

By default AngularJS compiles and executes all directives inside comments and element classes.
In order to perform this task, the AngularJS compiler must look for directives by:

- Parse all your application element classes.

- Parse all your application html comments.

Nowadays most of the AngularJS projects are using only element and attribute directives,
and in such projects there is no need to compile comments and classes.

If you are sure that your project only uses element and attribute directives,
and you are not using any 3rd party library that uses
directives inside element classes or html comments,
you can disable the compilation of directives on element classes and comments
for the whole application.
This results in a compilation performance gain,
as the compiler does not have to check comments and element classes looking for directives.

To disable comment and css class directives use the `$compileProvider`:

```
$compileProvider.commentDirectivesEnabled(false);
$compileProvider.cssClassDirectivesEnabled(false);
```

For more see the docs pages on
{@link ng.$compileProvider#commentDirectivesEnabled `$compileProvider.commentDirectivesEnabled`}
and
{@link ng.$compileProvider#cssClassDirectivesEnabled `$compileProvider.cssClassDirectivesEnabled`}.
