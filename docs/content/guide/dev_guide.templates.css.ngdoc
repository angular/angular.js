@description


Angular sets these CSS classes. It is up to your application to provide useful styling.

# CSS classes used by angular

* `ng-invalid`, `ng-vaild`

**Usage:** angular applies this class to an input widget element if that element's input does not
pass validation. (see {@link api/angular.widget.input input} widget).

* `ng-pristine`, `ng-dirty`

**Usage:** angular {@link api/angular.widget.input input} widget applies `ng-pristine` class to a new
input widget element which did not have user interaction. Once the user interacts with the input
widget the class is changed to `ng-dirty`.

# Marking CSS classes

* `ng-widget`, `ng-directive`

**Usage:** angular sets these class on elements where {@link api/angular.widget widget} or
{@link api/angular.directive directive} has bound to.


* Old browser support

Some older browsers can not select `ng:include` elements, because of the `:` character. For this
reason angular also sets `ng-include` class on any element which has `:` character in the name.
