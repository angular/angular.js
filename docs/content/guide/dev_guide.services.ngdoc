Services are a feature that angular brings to client-side web apps from the server side, where
services have been commonly used for a long time.  Services in angular apps are substitutable
objects that are wired together using {@link dev_guide.di dependency injection (DI)}. Services are
most often used with {@link dev_guide.di dependency injection}, also a key feature of angular apps.
