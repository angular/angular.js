The following sample code is our starting point.  It is a static HTML page that displays next to
nothing, but it has everything we need to proceed. You can think of this bit of code as our
prototype template, consisting of basic HTML tags with a pair of angular specific attributes. 

__`app/index.html`:__
<pre>
<!doctype html>
<html xmlns:ng="http://angularjs.org/">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>my angular app</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/app.css"/>
</head>
<body>

  Nothing here yet!

  <script src="lib/angular/angular.js" ng:autobind></script>
</body>
</html>
</pre>

## Discussion:

Although our app doesn't appear to do anything dynamic, note the following:

* __... `xmlns:ng="http://angularjs.org"` ...__  This `xmlns` declaration for the `ng` namespace
must be specified if you use XHTML, or if you are targeting IE older than 9 (regardless of whether
you are using XHTML or HTML).

* __`<script src="lib/angular/angular.js"` ...__ This downloads the `angular.js` script and
registers a callback that will be executed by the browser when the containing HTML page is fully
downloaded. When the callback is executed, angular looks for the {@link
angular.directive.ng:autobind ng:autobind} attribute. If `ng:autobind` is found, it signals
angular to bootstrap and compile and manage the whole html page.

    Note: If you elected not to download any tutorial files but still want to try out some angular
    code on your system, you can change the relative path to the `angular.js` script in your
    template from `./lib/angular/angular.js` to the following:

            <script src="http://code.angularjs.org/angular-0.9.14.js" ng:autobind></script>

    This will download the angular script from the angular server instead of from a local file.

* To try this code out in your browser, you need to navigate to the step-0 page (you are currently
on Step 0 of the tutorial). If your http server is running, navigate to `app/index.html`.
Remember, this is a relative URL (see the Relative URL section in {@link tutorial Tutorial}). The
browser will display the same thing as you would see if you go to
http://angular.github.com/angular-phonecat/step-0/app (accessible from Example link at the bottom
of the page).

Now we can move on and add some content to our developing web app.
