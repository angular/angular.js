the construction of an AngularJS web app. The app you will build is a catalog that displays a list
of Android devices, lets you filter the list to see only devices that interest you, and then view
details for any device.</p>

<p><img class="diagram" src="img/tutorial/catalog_screen.png" width="488" height="413"></p>

<p>Work through the tutorial to see how Angular makes browsers smarter â€” without the use of extensions
or plug-ins. As you work through the tutorial, you will:</p>

<ul>
<li>See examples of how to use client-side data binding and dependency injection to build dynamic
views of data that change immediately in response to user actions.</li>
<li>See how Angular creates listeners on your data without the need for DOM manipulation.</li>
<li>Learn a better, easier way to test your web apps.</li>
<li>Learn how to use Angular services to make common web tasks, such as getting data into your app,
easier.</li>
</ul>

<p>And all of this works in any browser without modification to the browser!</p>

<p>When you finish the tutorial you will be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a dynamic application that works in any browser.</li>
<li>Define the differences between Angular and common JavaScript frameworks.</li>
<li>Understand how data binding works in AngularJS.</li>
<li>Use the angular-seed project to quickly boot-strap your own projects.</li>
<li>Create and run tests.</li>
<li>Identify resources for learning more about AngularJS.</li>
</ul>

<p>The tutorial guides you through the entire process of building a simple application, including
writing and running unit and end-to-end tests. Experiments at the end of each step provide
suggestions for you to learn more about AngularJS and the application you are building.</p>

<p>You can go through the whole tutorial in a couple of hours or you may want to spend a pleasant day
really digging into it. If you're looking for a shorter introduction to AngularJS, check out the

<h2>Working with the code</h2>

<p>You can follow this tutorial and hack on the code in either the Mac/Linux or the Windows
environment. The tutorial relies on the use of Git versioning system for source code management.
You don't need to know anything about Git to follow the tutorial. Select one of the tabs below
and follow the instructions for setting up your computer.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p>You will need Node.js and Karma to run unit tests, so please verify that you have
      <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> v0.8 or better installed
      and that the <code>node</code> executable is on your <code>PATH</code> by running the following
      command in a terminal window:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">node --version</pre>
      <p>Additionally install <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/">Karma</a> if you
      don't have it already:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">npm install -g karma</pre>
      <li><p>You'll also need Git, which you can get from
         <a href="http://git-scm.com/download">the Git site</a>.</p></li>
      <li><p>Clone the angular-phonecat repository located at <a
href="https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat">Github</a> by running the following command:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">git clone git://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat.git</pre>
      <p>This command creates the <code>angular-phonecat</code> directory in your current
directory.</p></li>
      <li><p>Change your current directory to <code>angular-phonecat</code>:</p>
      <pre class="prettyprint linenums">cd angular-phonecat</pre>
      <p>The tutorial instructions assume you are running all commands from the angular-phonecat
directory.</p></li>
      <li><p>You will need an http server running on your system. Mac and Linux machines typically
have Apache pre-installed, but If you don't already have one installed, you can use <code>node</code>
to run <code>scripts/web-server.js</code>,  a simple bundled http server.</p></li>
    </ol>

      <p>The tutorial instructions assume you are running all commands from the angular-phonecat
directory.</p>
      <p>You should run all <code>git</code> commands from Git bash.</p>
      <p>Other commands like <code>test.bat</code> or <code>e2e-test.bat</code> should be
executed from the Windows command line.</li>
      <li><p>You need an http server running on your system, but if you don't already have one
already installed, you can use <code>node</code> to run <code>scripts\web-server.js</code>, a simple
bundled http server.</p></li>

<p>The last thing to do is to make sure your computer has a web browser and a good text editor
installed. Now, let's get some cool stuff done!</p>
